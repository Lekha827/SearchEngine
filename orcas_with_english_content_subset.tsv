For """", see Inverted question and exclamation marks . For other uses, see ! (disambiguation) . ""Pling"" redirects here. For the Swedish lyricist nicknamed Pling, see Ingela Forsman . ! Exclamation mark Unicode : U0021 ! EXCLAMATION MARK The exclamation mark ! (also known as exclamation point in American English ) is a punctuation mark usually used after an interjection or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or to show emphasis . The exclamation mark often marks the end of a sentence, for example: ""Watch out!"". Similarly, a bare exclamation mark (with nothing before or after) is often used in warning signs . The exclamation mark is often used in writing to make a character seem as though they are shouting, excited, or surprised. Other uses include: In mathematics , it denotes the factorial operation. [ 1 ] Several computer languages use ! at the beginning of an expression to denote logical negation . For example, !A means ""the logical negation of A"", also called ""not A"". This usage has spread to ordinary language (e.g., ""!clue"" means no-clue or clueless). Some languages use  , a symbol that looks like an exclamation mark, to denote a click consonant . History [ edit ] Graphically, the exclamation mark is represented by variations on the theme of a period with a vertical line above. One theory of its origin posits derivation from a Latin exclamation of joy, namely io , analogous to ""hooray""; copyists wrote the Latin word io at the end of a sentence, to indicate expression of joy. Over time, the i moved above the o ; that o first became smaller, and (with time) a dot. [ 2 ] Its evolution as a punctuation symbol after the Ancient Era can be traced back to the Middle Ages , when scribes would often add various marks and symbols to manuscripts to indicate changes in tone , pauses , or emphasis . [ 3 ] These symbols included the punctus admirativus, [ 4 ] a symbol that was similar in shape to the modern exclamation mark and was used to indicate admiration, surprise, or other strong emotions. [ 5 ] The modern use of the exclamation mark was supposedly first described in the 14th century by Italian scholar Alpoleio da Urbisaglia. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] According to 21st-century literary scholar Florence Hazrat, [ 9 ] da Urbisaglia ""felt very annoyed"" that people were reading script with a flat tone, even when written to elicit emotions. The exclamation mark was introduced into English printing during this time to show emphasis . [ 10 ] It was later called by many names, including point of admiration (1611), [ 11 ] [ a ] note of exclamation or admiration (1657), [ 12 ] sign of admiration or exclamation , [ 13 ] exclamation point (1824), [ 14 ] and finally, exclamation mark (1839). [ 15 ] Many older or portable typewriters did not have the exclamation mark. Instead the user typed a period and then backspaced and overtyped an apostrophe . [ 16 ] Slang and other names for the exclamation mark [ edit ] Now obsolete, the name ecphoneme was documented in the early 20th century. [ 17 ] In the 1950s, secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as ""bang"", [ 18 ] [ 19 ] perhaps from comic books  where the ! appeared in dialogue bubbles to represent a gun being fired [ 20 ]  although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing. [ 21 ] This ""bang"" usage is behind the names of the interrobang , an unconventional typographic character, and the shebang , a feature of Unix computer systems. In the printing world, the exclamation mark can be called a screamer, a gasper, a slammer, a dog's cock, [ 22 ] or a startler. [ 23 ] In hacker culture , the exclamation mark is called ""bang"", ""shriek"", or, in the British slang known as Commonwealth Hackish, "" pling "". For example, the password communicated in the spoken phrase ""Your password is em-zero-pee-aitch-bang-en-three"" ("" em-nought-pee-aitch-pling-en-three "" in Commonwealth Hackish) is m0ph!n3 . [ 24 ] Languages [ edit ] The exclamation mark is mainly used in languages that use the Latin alphabet , although usage slightly varies. It has also been adopted in languages written in other scripts, such as languages written with Cyrillic or Arabic scripts, Chinese characters , and Devanagari . English [ edit ] A sentence ending in an exclamation mark may represent an exclamation or an interjection (such as ""Wow!"", ""Boo!""), or an imperative (""Stop!""), or may indicate astonishment or surprise: ""They were the footprints of a gigantic hound!"" Exclamation marks are occasionally placed mid-sentence with a function similar to a comma, for dramatic effect, although this usage is obsolete: ""On the walk, oh! there was a frightful noise."" [ 25 ] Informally, exclamation marks may be repeated for additional emphasis (""That's great!!!""), but this practice is generally considered unacceptable in formal prose. [ 26 ] The exclamation mark is sometimes used in conjunction with the question mark . This can be in protest or astonishment (""Out of all places, the squatter-camp?!""); a few writers replace this with a single, nonstandard punctuation mark, the interrobang , which is the combination of a question mark and an exclamation mark. [ 27 ] Overly frequent use of the exclamation mark is generally considered poor writing, as it distracts the reader and decreases the mark's significance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Cut out all these exclamation points... An exclamation point is like laughing at your own joke.  F. Scott Fitzgerald [ 30 ] Some authors, most notably Tom Wolfe , are known for unashamedly liberal use of the exclamation mark. In comic books , the very frequent use of exclamation mark is commonsee Comics , below. For information on the use of spaces after an exclamation mark, see the discussion of spacing after a period . Several studies have shown that women use exclamation marks more than men do. One study suggests that, in addition to other uses, exclamation marks may also function as markers of friendly interaction, for example, by making ""Hi!"" or ""Good luck!"" seem friendlier than simply ""Hi."" or ""Good luck."" (with periods). [ 31 ] However, use of exclamation marks in contexts that are not unambiguously positive can be misinterpreted as indicating hostility. In English writing and often subtitles , a (!) symbol (an exclamation mark within parentheses ) implies that a character has made an obviously sarcastic comment e.g.: "" Ooh, a sarcasm detector. That's a really useful invention(!) "" [ 32 ] It also is used to indicate surprise at one's own experience or statement. French [ edit ] In French, as well as marking exclamations or indicating astonishment, the exclamation mark is also commonly used to mark orders or requests: Viens ici ! (English: 'Come here!'). When available, a 'narrow no-break space' ( espace fine inscable ) is used between the last word and the exclamation mark in European French. If not, a regular non-breaking space ( espace inscable ) is currently used. In Canadian French, either no space is used or a small space ( espace fine inscable ) is inserted if available. One can also combine an exclamation mark with a question mark at the end of a sentence where appropriate. German [ edit ] German uses the exclamation mark for several things that English conveys with other punctuation : [ 33 ] [ 34 ] It is used at the end of imperative sentences, even when not particularly emphatic: Ruf mich morgen an! (English: 'Call me tomorrow.') A normal period, as in English, is fairly common but is considered substandard. A related use is on signs that express a command or interdiction: Betreten verboten! (English: 'No trespassing!'). The exclamation mark may also be used in the salutation line of a letter: Lieber Hans! (English: 'Dear Hans,'). However, the use of a comma is equally correct and is more common. Cantonese [ edit ] Cantonese has not historically used dedicated punctuation marks, rather relying on grammatical markers to denote the end of a statement. Usage of exclamation marks is common in written Mandarin and in some Yue speaking regions. [ 35 ] The Canton and Hong Kong regions, however, generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations; however, an exclamation mark, including in some written representations of colloquy in Cantonese , can be used informally to indicate strong feeling. Greek [ edit ] In Modern Greek , the exclamation mark (  , thavmastik ) has been introduced from Latin scripts and is used identically, although without the reluctance seen in English usage . [ 36 ] A minor grammatical difference is that, while a series of interjections each employ an exclamation mark (e.g., ! ! , ch! Ach! , 'Oops! Oh!'), an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by a comma (e.g., ,      ! , ch, xchasa to mti ts kouznas anoicht! , 'Oops! I left the stove on.'). Hungarian [ edit ] In Hungarian , an exclamation mark is put at the end of exclamatory, imperative or prohibitive sentences, and sentences expressing a wish (e.g. De szp!  'How beautiful!', A fre lpni tilos!  'Keep off the grass', Brcsak sikerlne a tervem!  'If only my plan would work out.'). The use of the exclamation mark is also needed when addressing someone and the addressing is a separate sentence. (typically at the beginning of letters, e.g. Kedves Pter!  'Dear Peter,'). [ 37 ] Greetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark (e.g. J estt!  'Good evening.'). Solomon Islands Pidgin [ edit ] In Solomon Islands Pidgin , the phrase may be between admiration marks. Compare Nomoa. (""No."") and !Nomoa nao! (""Certainly not!""). [ 38 ] Spanish [ edit ] Trilingual billboard in Barcelona (detail), showing the initial exclamation mark for Spanish, but not for Catalan (top line) and English In Spanish, a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an inverted exclamation mark (the same also applies to the question mark): Ests loco? Casi la matas! , 'Are you crazy? You almost killed her!' As in British English, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at a statement: Dice que esta noche no va a salir de fiesta (!) , 'He said that he's not going to a party tonight(!).' Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark. [ 39 ] Turkish [ edit ] In Turkish , an exclamation mark is used after a sentence or phrase for emphasis , and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Ordular! lk hedefiniz Akdenizdir, ileri! ('Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean') order by Atatrk , ordular ('the armies') constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses, (!) , after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm : ok iyi bir i yaptn (!) , 'You've done a very good job  Not! '. [ 40 ] Limbu [ edit ] This section contains uncommon Unicode characters. Without proper rendering support , you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of the intended characters. In Limbu , an exclamation mark (  ) is used after a Limbu sentence or phrase for emphasis , and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Limbu sentence    Mediterranean,  ( Pau! Ghwapha khcathaa Mediterranean, ausaa! , 'Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean !'). It is further used in parentheses, (  ), after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm :      () ( Rkhatha maala pai yancha gaugha (!) , 'You did a very good job  Not! '). [ citation needed ] Phonetics [ edit ] In Khoisan languages , and the International Phonetic Alphabet , a symbol that looks like the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the postalveolar click sound (represented as q in Zulu orthography). It is actually a vertical bar with underdot. In Unicode , this letter is properly coded as U01C3  LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol U0021 ! EXCLAMATION MARK to allow software to deal properly with word breaks. The exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a phonetic symbol to indicate that a consonant is ejective . More commonly this is represented by an apostrophe , or a superscript glottal stop symbol ( U02C0  MODIFIER LETTER GLOTTAL STOP ). Proper names [ edit ] Although not part of dictionary words, exclamation marks appear in some brand names and trade names , including Yum! Brands (parent of fast food chains like Taco Bell and KFC ), Web services Yahoo! and Joomla! , and the online game Kahoot! . It appears in the titles of stage and screen works, especially comedies and musicals ; examples include the game show Jeopardy! ; the '60s musical TV show Shindig! ; musicals Oklahoma! , Mamma Mia! , Oliver! and Oh! Calcutta! ; and movies Airplane! and Moulin Rouge! . Writer Elliot S! Maggin and cartoonist Scott Shaw! include exclamation marks in their names. In the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Republican candidate Jeb Bush used ""Jeb!"" as his campaign logo. Place names [ edit ] Road sign marking the entrance to Westward Ho! The English town of Westward Ho! , named after the novel by Charles Kingsley , is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark. [ 41 ] There is a town in Quebec called Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! , which is spelled with two exclamation marks. [ 42 ] The city of Hamilton, Ohio , changed its name to Hamilton! in 1986, but neither the United States Board on Geographic Names nor mapmakers Rand McNally recognised the change. [ 43 ] The city of Ostrava , Czech Republic , changed its logotype to Ostrava!!! in 2008. [ 44 ] Warnings [ edit ] A hazard warning sign with an exclamation mark. New Zealand road sign warning of a ""cattle stop"" ( cattle grid /cattle guard) Exclamation marks are used to emphasize a precautionary statement . On warning signs , an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to a warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle with a red border is common on European road warning signs . (In most cases, a pictogram indicating the nature of the hazard is enclosed in the triangle but an exclamation mark may be used instead as a generic symbol; a plate beneath identifies the hazard.) Use in various fields [ edit ] Mathematics and formal logic [ edit ] Further information: Glossary of mathematical symbols In elementary mathematics , the symbol represents the factorial operation. The expression n ! means ""the product of the integers from 1 to n "". For example, 4! (read four factorial ) is 4  3  2  1  24. (0! is defined as 1, [ 45 ] which is a neutral element in multiplication , not multiplied by anything.) Additionally, it can also represent the uniqueness quantifier or, if used in front of a number, it can represent a subfactorial . In linear logic , the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction. Computing [ edit ] In computing , the exclamation mark is ASCII character 33 (21 in hexadecimal ). Due to its availability even on early computers, the character was used for many purposes. The name given to ""!"" by programmers varies according to their background, though it was very common to give it a short name to make reading code aloud easier. ""Bang"" [ 46 ] is very popular. In the UK the term pling was popular in the earlier days of computing, whilst in the United States, the term shriek was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and shriek is from Stanford or MIT; however, shriek for the ! sign is found in the Oxford English Dictionary dating from the 1860s. Many computer languages using C-style syntax use ""!"" for logical negation ; !A means ""not A"", and A ! B means ""A is not equal to B"". This negation principle has spread to ordinary language; for example, the word ""!clue"" is used as a synonym for ""no-clue"" or ""clueless"". [ 47 ] [ 48 ] The symbol in formal logic for negation is  but, as this symbol is not present as standard on most keyboards, the C convention has spread informally to other contexts. Early e-mail systems also used the exclamation mark as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as "" bang path "" notation. In the IRC protocol, a user's nickname and ident are separated by an exclamation mark in the hostmask assigned to him or her by the server. In UNIX scripting (typically for UNIX shell or Perl ), ""!"" is usually used after a """" in the first line of a script, the interpreter directive , to tell the OS what program to use to run the script. ! is usually called a ""hash-bang"" or shebang . A similar convention for PostScript files calls for the first line to begin with ! , called ""percent-bang"". [ 49 ] An exclamation mark starts history expansions in many Unix shells such as bash and tcsh where !! executes the previous command and ! refers to all of the arguments from the previous command. Acorn RISC OS uses filenames starting with pling to create an application directory : for instance a file called !Run is executed when the folder containing it is double-clicked (holding down shift prevents this). There is also !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), !Sprites (icons), !Help , and others. In APL , !x is used for factorial of x (backwards from math notation), and also for the binomial coefficient : k!n means ( n k ) displaystyle tbinom nk or n !  k !( n  k )! . BBC BASIC used pling as an indirection operator, equivalent to PEEK and POKE of four bytes at once. [ 50 ] BCPL , the precursor of C , used ""!"" for pointer and array indirection: !P is equivalent to P in C, and P!3 is equivalent to P[3] in C. In the Xbase family of programming languages, which includes dBase and FoxPro , an exclamation mark, when used as part of an expression, indicates negation. For example, ! means ""not equal to"". At the start of a line of code, it is a synonym for RUN (which executes an external program). [ 51 ] [ 52 ] In the Haskell programming language, ""!"" is used to express strictness. In the Kotlin programming language, ""!!"" (""double-bang"") is the not-null assertion operator, used to override null safety so as to allow a null pointer exception. [ 53 ] In the ML programming language (including Standard ML and OCaml ), ""!"" is the operator to get the value out of a ""reference"" data structure. In the Raku programming language, the ""!"" twigil is used to access private attributes or methods in a class (like class Person  has !name ;  or self ! private-method ; ). [ 54 ] In the Scheme , [ 55 ] Julia , [ 56 ] and Ruby programming languages, ""!"" is conventionally the suffix for functions and special forms that mutate their input. In the Swift programming language, a type followed by ""!"" denotes an ""implicitly unwrapped optional"", an option type where the compiler does not enforce safe unwrapping. The ""!"" operator ""force unwraps"" an option type, causing an error if it is nil. In Geek Code version 3, ""!"" is used before a letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as G! denoting a geek of no qualifications, !d denoting not wearing any clothes, P! denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations, however. ! is used to denote changed lines in diff output in the context format . In the unified format , changes to a single line are denoted as an addition and deletion. Video games [ edit ] The exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that a character is startled or alarmed. In the Metal Gear and Paper Mario series, an exclamation mark appears over enemies' heads when they notice the player. In massively multiplayer online (MMO) games such as World of Warcraft , an exclamation mark hovering over a character's head is often used to indicate that they are offering a quest for the player to complete. In Dota 2 , an exclamation mark is shown above the head of a unit if it is killed by means not granting enemies experience or gold (if it is ""denied""). In the 2005 arcade dance simulation game In the Groove 2 , there is a song titled ""!"" (also referred to as ""bang"") by the artist Onyx. Internet culture [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( November 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In Internet culture , especially where leet is used, multiple exclamation marks may be affixed with the numeral ""1"" as in !!!!!!111 . The notation originates from a common error: when typing multiple exclamation points quickly, the typist may fail to hold the  Shift 1 combination that produces the exclamation mark on many keyboard layouts . This error, first used intentionally as a joke in the leet linguistic community, is now an accepted form of exclamation in leet and derivative dialects such as Lolspeak . [ 57 ] Some utterances include further substitutions, for example ""!!!111oneeleven"". [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In fandom and fanfiction , ! is used to signify a defining quality in a character, usually signifying an alternative interpretation of a character from a canonical work. Examples of this would be ""Romantic!Draco"" or ""Vampire!Harry"" from Harry Potter fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of a character with multiple identities or appearances, such as to distinguish ""Armor! Al "" from ""Human!Al"" in a work based on Fullmetal Alchemist . The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, for example, ""Football Player! Leonardo"", ""Rockstar! Raphael"", and ""Breakdancer! Michelangelo"". [ citation needed ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Comics [ edit ] This Action Comics cover from 1959 ends every sentence with an exclamation point or question mark . Often, few or no periods would be used in the entire book. Some comic books , especially superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee , as editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics , attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences. [ 62 ] Comic book writer Elliot S! Maggin once accidentally signed his name with an exclamation due to the habit of using them when writing comic scripts; it became his professional name from then on. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Similarly, comic artist Scott Shaw! has used the exclamation point after his name throughout his career. In comic books and comics in general, a large exclamation point is often used near or over a character's head to indicate surprise. A question mark can similarly be used to indicate confusion. Chess [ edit ] Main article: Punctuation (chess) In chess notation ""!"" denotes a good move, ""!!"" denotes an excellent move, ""?!"" denotes a dubious move, and ""!?"" denotes an interesting, risky move. In some chess variants such as large-board Shogi variants , ""!"" is used to record pieces capturing by stationary feeding or burning. Scrabble [ edit ] In Scrabble , an exclamation mark written after a word is used to indicate its presence in the Official Tournament and Club Word List but its absence from the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary , usually because the word has been judged offensive. Baseball [ edit ] Exclamation points or asterisks can be used on scorecards to denote a ""great defensive play"". [ 65 ] Popular music [ edit ] The band !!! (pronounced ""Chk Chk Chk"") uses exclamation points as its name. [ 66 ] In 2008, the pop-punk band Panic! at the Disco dropped the exclamation point in its name; this became the ""most-discussed topic on [fan] message boards around the world"". [ 67 ] In 2009, the exclamation mark was re-inserted following the band's split. [ 68 ] The band Bomb the Music Industry! utilizes an exclamation mark in its name, as well as several album and song titles and promotional material. Examples include their songs ""(Shut) Up The Punx!!!"" and the album Adults!!!: Smart!!! Shithammered!!! And Excited by Nothing!!!!!!! . American musician Pink stylizes her stage name ""P!NK"", [ 69 ] and uses three exclamation points in the subtitle of her 2010 release, Greatest Hits... So Far!!! . [ 70 ] Television [ edit ] The exclamation mark was included in the title of Dinah Shore 's TV series, Dinah! The exclamation mark was later the subject of a bitter argument between Elaine Benes and her boyfriend, Jake Jarmel, in the Seinfeld episode, "" The Sniffing Accountant "". Elaine got upset with Jake for not putting an exclamation mark at the end of a message about her friend having a baby. Jake took extreme exception to the trivial criticism and broke up with Elaine, putting an exclamation mark after his parting words: ""I'm leaving!""

( April 2020 )   Upside-down question mark Upside-down exclamation mark U00BF  INVERTED QUESTION MARK U00A1  INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK The upside-down (also inverted , turned or rotated ) question mark  and exclamation mark  are punctuation marks used to begin interrogative and exclamatory sentences or clauses in Spanish and some languages that have cultural ties with Spain, such as Asturian and Waray . [ 1 ] The initial marks are mirrored at the end of the sentence or clause by the ordinary question mark , ? , or exclamation mark , ! . Upside-down marks are supported by various standards, including ISO-8859-1 , Unicode , and HTML . They can be entered directly on keyboards designed for Spanish-speaking countries. Usage [ edit ] Main article: Spanish orthography Punctuation marks in Spanish, showing their positions relative to the baseline The upside-down question mark  is written before the first letter of an interrogative sentence or clause to indicate that a question follows. It is a rotated form of the standard symbol ""?"" recognized by speakers of other languages written with the Latin script . A regular question mark is written at the end of the sentence or clause. Upside-down punctuation is especially critical in Spanish since the syntax of the language means that both statements and questions or exclamations could have the same wording. [ 2 ] ""Do you like summer?"" and ""You like summer."" are translated respectively as ""Te gusta el verano?"" and ""Te gusta el verano."" (There is not always a difference between the wording of a yesno question and the corresponding statement in Spanish.) In sentences that are both declarative and interrogative, the clause that asks a question is isolated with the starting-symbol upside-down question mark, for example: ""Si no puedes ir con ellos, quieres ir con nosotros?"" (""If you cannot go with them, would you like to go with us?""), not  ""Si no puedes ir con ellos, quieres ir con nosotros?"" This helps to recognize questions and exclamations in long sentences. Unlike the ending marks, which are printed along the baseline of the text, the upside-down marks ( and ) descend below the line . History [ edit ] Upside-down marks, simple in the era of hand typesetting, were originally recommended by the Real Academia Espaola (Royal Spanish Academy), in the second edition of the Ortografa de la lengua castellana (Orthography of the Castilian language) in 1754 [ 3 ] recommending it as the symbol indicating the beginning of a question in written Spanishe.g. ""Cuntos aos tienes?"" (""How old are you?""; lit. ' How many years do you have? ' ). The Real Academia also ordered the same upside-down-symbol system for statements of exclamation, using the symbols """" and ""!"". These new rules were slow to be adopted: there are 19th-century books in which the printer uses neither """" nor """". [ citation needed ] Outside of the Spanish-speaking world, John Wilkins proposed using the upside-down exclamation mark """" as a symbol at the end of a sentence to denote irony in 1668. He was one of many, including Desiderius Erasmus , who felt there was a need for such a punctuation mark, but Wilkins' proposal, like the other attempts, failed to take hold. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Adoption [ edit ] Some writers omit the upside-down question mark in the case of a short unambiguous question such as: ""Quin viene?"" (""Who comes?""). This is the criterion in Galician [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and formerly in Catalan . [ 8 ] Certain Catalan-language authorities, such as Joan Sol i Cortassa , insist that both the opening and closing question marks be used for clarity. [ citation needed ] The current Institute for Catalan Studies prescription is never to use the upside-down marks for Catalan. [ 9 ] Some Spanish-language writers, among them Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda (19041973), refuse to use the upside-down question mark. [ 10 ] Mixtures [ edit ] It is acceptable in Spanish to begin a sentence with an opening upside-down exclamation mark ("""") and end it with a question mark (""?""), or vice versa, for statements that are questions but also have a clear sense of exclamation or surprise such as: Y t quin te crees? (""And who do you think you are?!""). Normally, four signs are used, always with one type in the outer side and the other in the inner side (nested) ( Y t quin te crees!? , Y t quin te crees?! [ 11 ] ) Unicode 5.1 also includes U2E18  INVERTED INTERROBANG , which is an upside-down version of the interrobang , a nonstandard punctuation mark used to denote both excitement and a question in one glyph. It is also known as a ""gnaborretni"" [ citation needed ] ( /   n  b r   t . n i / ) ( interrobang spelled backwards). Computer usage [ edit ] Encodings [ edit ]  and  are in the ""Latin-1 Supplement"" Unicode block ,  which is inherited from ISO-8859-1 : U00A1  INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK U00BF  INVERTED QUESTION MARK Typing the character [ edit ] The  character is accessible using AltGr 1 on a modern US-International keyboard. It is also available using a conventional US keyboard by switching to the US-International keyboard layout .  and  are available in all keyboard layouts designed for Spanish-speaking countries. Smart phones typically offer these if you hold down ? or ! in the on-screen keyboard. Auto-correct will often turn a normal mark typed at the start of a sentence to the upside-down one. On systems with an AltGr key (actual or emulated via right Alt key ) and Extended (or 'International') keyboard mapping set, the symbols can be accessed directly, though the sequence varies by OS and locality and is documented by the vendor.

(Brand New Images/Getty Images) By Richard Nordquist Richard Nordquist English and Rhetoric Professor Ph.D., Rhetoric and English, University of Georgia M.A., Modern English and American Literature, University of Leicester B.A., English, State University of New York Dr. Richard Nordquist is professor emeritus of rhetoric and English at Georgia Southern University and the author of several university-level grammar and composition textbooks. Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on December 18, 2018 Close An exclamation point (!) is a mark of punctuation used after a word, phrase, or sentence that expresses a strong emotion. It ends emphatic statements, says "" English Grammar  Punctuation ,"" a reference guide. William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White, in their famous "" Elements of Style ,"" say that: ""The exclamation mark is to be reserved for after true exclamations and commands."" And "" Merriam-Webster's Guide to Punctuation and Style "" notes that the exclamation point is used ""to mark a forceful comment or exclamation."" It is also called an exclamation mark or tellingly, in newspaper jargon, a shriek . These sources and others may define it with different vocabulary, but they all agree on one thing: The exclamation point is possibly the most overused punctuation mark in the English language. Multiple exclamation points (or marks )two or, often, three exclamation marks (!!!) following a word or sentenceshould be even rarer still in good writing. History The exclamation point was first used by printers at the end of the 15th century, according to Thomas MacKellar, in his 1885 book, "" The American Printer: A Manual of Typography ."" MacKellar also noted that the punctuation meant ""admiration or exclamation"" as well as ""surprise, astonishment, rapture, and the like sudden emotions of the mind."" The mark, itself, comes from Latin, says Smithsonian.com : ""In Latin, the exclamation of joy was io, where the i was written above the o . And, since all their letters were written as capitals, an I with an O below it looks a lot like an exclamation point."" It wasnt until 1970 that the exclamation point had its own key on the keyboard, the Smithsonian notes, adding that before that you had to type a period, and then use the backspace to go back and stick an apostrophe above it. When executives dictated to secretaries, they would say ""bang"" to indicate the exclamation point, leading to the term interbang , a nonstandard punctuation mark in the form of a question mark superimposed on an exclamation point (sometimes appearing as ?!). It is used to end a rhetorical question or a simultaneous question and exclamation. Some writers, then, began using multiple exclamation points as a logical outgrowth of the interbang and single exclamation mark to add even more emphasis to words, phrases, and sentences. Purpose The use of the exclamation pointand, even more so, multiple exclamation pointshas been met with plenty of controversy and criticism. Smithsonian notes this less-than-pleased response by F. Scott Fitzgerald to the use of multiple exclamation points: Cut out all those exclamation marks. An exclamation mark is like laughing at your own jokes. Author Elmore Leonard was even more incensed by their use: You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose. Leonard also said that use of multiple exclamation points is the ""sign of a diseased mind."" Still, exclamation points do have a purpose in the English language, according to the late Rene ""Jack"" Cappon , a longtime editor at the Associated Press and author of "" The Associated Press Guide to Punctuation ."" Cappon said that exclamation points are certainly not subtle; instead, they act like a ""kettle drum,"" noisily calling readers' attention to a given word, phrase, or sentence. Echoing the very earliest use of this punctuation mark, Cappon says you should use exclamation points to convey pain, fear, astonishment, anger, and disgust, as in:  'Ouch! My toes!' cries one, a bowling ball dropped on his foot. 'Somebody help me!' screams a damsel in distress. 'Look, a real unicorn!' Astonishment. 'Get thee behind me, Satan!' Rage and disgust."" Cappon notes that you rarely run into emotional outbursts like these, so you should use single or multiple exclamation points sparingly. He and other grammar and punctuation experts point out that you should generally let the words speak for themselves, set off by a simple period , comma , or semicolon . Otherwise, you risk damaging your credibility by constantly yelling at your readers, similar to someone screaming ""fire"" in a crowded theater, even when there is not a hint of smoke. Rules for Using Exclamation Marks Richard Bullock, Michal Brody, and Francine Weinberg note in the "" The Little Seagull Handbook ,"" a grammar, punctuation, and style guide used on many college campuses, that you should use exclamation points to express strong emotion or add emphasis to a statement or command. They give this example of when to use an exclamation point, from Susan Jane Gilman's "" Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress: Tales of Growing Up Groovy and Clueless ,"" who described seeing ""The Rolling Stones"" band member Keith Richards: "" ' Keith,' we shrieked as the car drove away. 'Keith, we love you! ' "" Encountering a member of the iconic rock bandand the shrieking that accompanied the sightingwould, indeed, call for at least one exclamation pointand perhaps more!!!to emphasize the excitement of the moment. Another example of when to use exclamation points is illustrated in this pithy quote from Tennessee Williams in ""Camino Real."" ""Make voyages! Attempt them! There's nothing else."" You can also use multiple exclamation points in informal or comic writing, or to express sarcasm , as in: I loved your last email! OMG did I LOVE it!!! The point is that the writer of the above sentences didn't really love the email. She was being ironic , which the multiple exclamation points help to show. Additionally, David Crystal, in "" Making a Point: The Persnickety Story of English Punctuation ,"" gives these examples where the contexts dictate when exclamation marks would be acceptable, even expected: Interjections - Oh! Expletives - Damn! Greetings - Happy Xmas!!! Calls - Johnny! Commands - Stop! Expressions of surprise - What a mess!!! Emphatic statements - I want to see you now! Attention-getters - Listen carefully! Loud speech in dialogue - I'm in the garden! Ironic comments - He paid, for a change! or . . . for a change (!) Strong mental attitudes - ""Hardly!"" he thought When to Omit Exclamation Points But there are many other instances where you should omit exclamation points, as in this example from ""The Little Seagull Handbook."" ""It was so close, so low, so huge and fast, so intent on its target that I swear to you, I swear to you, I felt the vengeance and rage emanating from the plane."" - Debra Fontaine, ""Witnessing"" Bill Walsh, the late copy chief for the Washington Post , noted in "" The Elephants of Style: A Trunkload of Tips on the Big Issues and Gray Areas of Contemporary American English "" that you should omit exclamation points (and other punctuation marks) when they are, essentially, gimmicky ""decorations"" for company names. So, says Walsh, you would write Yahoo, not Yahoo! ""The Associated Press Stylebook"" also notes that you place exclamation points within quote marks when they are part of the quoted material, as in: ""How wonderful!"" he exclaimed. ""Never!"" she shouted. But place exclamation points outside of quotation marks when they are not part of the quoted material: ""I hated reading Spenser's ""Faerie Queene""! And never use other punctuation marks, such as a comma, after an exclamation point: Wrong: ""Halt!"", the corporal cried. Right: ""Halt!"" the corporal cried. So, when using exclamation points remember that less is more. Use this punctuation markwhether it be one, two, or three exclamation pointsonly when the context calls for it. Otherwise, let your prose speak for themselves and save the mighty exclamation point for extreme circumstances, for heaven's sake!!!

Its less common than the period or question mark , but its very easy to use. Some might say its too easy to use. What is an exclamation point for? Periods go at the end of declarative sentences , question marks go at the end of interrogative sentences, and exclamation points go at the end of exclamatory sentences. An exclamatory sentence is one that expresses a strong or forceful emotion, such as anger, surprise, or joy. Heres a tip: Want to make sure your writing shines? Grammarly can check your spelling and save you from grammar and punctuation mistakes. It even proofreads your text, so your work is extra polished wherever you write. Your writing, at its best Grammarly helps you communicate confidently Write with Grammarly I got a perfect score on the SAT! Get out of my sight! Exclamation points are also commonly found with sentence fragments or sudden interjections. Occasionally, you might see one at the end of a sentence that is phrased as a question. Careful! That spider is poisonous. Holy cow! How could I have forgotten to pack underwear! Exclamatory quotations Using an exclamation point is usually quite simpleyou just put it at the end of the sentence. But it can get a little tricky when you also have a quotation mark at the end of the sentence. Here are the rules: Put the exclamation point inside the closing quotation marks if it applies to the words enclosed by the quotation marks. Theres a spider on my arm! yelped Jeremy. If the exclamation point applies to the sentence as a whole, then place it at the very end. And then the paramedics tried to tell Jeremy it was only a spider! Exclamation points and parentheses Put the exclamation point inside the parentheses when it applies to the words inside the parentheses. Jeremy didnt find out until later what kind of spider it was (a black widow!). Put the exclamation point outside the parentheses if it applies to the whole sentence. They settled out of court and Jeremy got a million dollars (cash)! Using exclamation points and parentheses this way is relatively rare. Exclamation abuse The hardest thing about using an exclamation point is probably knowing when not to use one. In writing , its often hard to convey the emotion and intent behind a simple statement. If you spoke the words I cant believe you threw me a surprise party aloud, it would be clear from the tone of your voice and body language whether you meant this as an expression of gratitude or reproach. An exclamation point can help make it clear by conveying your excitement: I cant believe you threw me a surprise party! But using too many exclamation marks makes them less effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald said that using exclamation marks is like laughing at your own jokes. After a while, your readers will simply ignore them, or worse, become annoyed by them. On top of that, theyre considered to be relatively casual, so using them in business or formal academic writing is a no-no. Instead of relying on exclamation points to convey your urgency or excitement, use more vivid vocabulary. Instead of Make sure you finish this by tomorrow morning! try Its crucial that you finish this before tomorrow mornings deadline. Congratulations!

Ellipses [ ] Brackets ( ) Parentheses  Apostrophe / Apostrophe   Angle brackets   Braces  Other matters Style Titles of works Word processors British versus American style Exclamation point The most flagrant way a writer demonstrates contempt for his readers is by ignoring punctuation altogether. A close second is the abundant use of the exclamation point. Some writers even use three or more exclamation points, lest the reader not fully grasp the significance of what is being said. To be effective, the exclamation point should be used in moderation. At the end of a sentence The exclamation point is a mark of terminal punctuation. As such, it should not be followed by a period or question mark. Some writers will use both a question mark and exclamation point for an exclamatory question, but only the exclamation point is truly necessary. Correct What in the world are you doing up there! Incorrect What in the world are you doing up there ? ! There is a punctuation mark that combines the question mark and exclamation point. It is called the interrobang, and it looks like this:  Yet, for reasons already explained, it is hardly needed. The greatest confusion arises when exclamation points and other punctuation marks appear at the end of a sentence. For examples of most such pairings, see the terminal punctuation chart . In the middle of a sentence When a quotation ends with an exclamation point, a comma that would ordinarily be placed inside the closing quotation mark is omitted. Example Get out, Marcus said. Correct Get out! Marcus yelled. Incorrect Get out! ,  Marcus yelled. As part of a title of work If the exclamation point is part of a title of work or a proper noun, the comma should be retained. Examples His latest short story, Dont Make a Sound!, is his most suspenseful yet. Her first novel, Excite! , was a critical hit. After five years in the sales department at Yahoo!, he took a marketing job at Google. As editorial comment Writers sometimes place an exclamation point in brackets to indicate their surprise or amusement at something being quoted. Avoid this in formal writing.

It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs . It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels [ 7 ] ), device drivers , and protocol stacks , but its use in application software has been decreasing. [ 8 ] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems . A successor to the programming language B , C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix . It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. [ 9 ] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems . The book The C Programming Language , co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. [ 12 ] [ 1 ] C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming , lexical variable scope , and recursion , with a static type system . It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards -compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top four languages in the TIOBE index , a measure of the popularity of programming languages. [ 13 ] Overview [ edit ] Dennis Ritchie (right), the inventor of the C programming language, with Ken Thompson C is an imperative , procedural language in the ALGOL tradition.  It has a static type system . In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called ""functions"", though not in the sense of functional programming ). Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as pointers , i.e. the address of the first item in the array. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointers to the thing being referenced. C program source text is free-form code. Semicolons terminate statements , while curly braces are used to group statements into blocks . The C language also exhibits the following characteristics: The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow primitives: if/else , for , do/while , while , and switch . User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil . It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise , and logic operators:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , etc. More than one assignment may be performed in a single statement. Functions: Function return values can be ignored, when not needed. Function and data pointers permit ad hoc run-time polymorphism . Functions may not be defined within the lexical scope of other functions. Variables may be defined within a function, with scope . A function may call itself, so recursion is supported. Data typing is static , but weakly enforced ; all data has a type, but implicit conversions are possible. User-defined ( typedef ) and compound types are possible. Heterogeneous aggregate data types ( struct ) allow related data elements to be accessed and assigned as a unit. The contents of whole structs cannot be compared using a single built-in operator (the elements must be compared individually). Union is a structure with overlapping members; it allows multiple data types to share the same memory location. Array indexing is a secondary notation, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic. Whole arrays cannot be assigned or compared using a single built-in operator. There is no ""array"" keyword in use or definition; instead, square brackets indicate arrays syntactically, for example month[11] . Enumerated types are possible with the enum keyword. They are freely interconvertible with integers. Strings are not a distinct data type, but are conventionally implemented as null-terminated character arrays. Low-level access to computer memory is possible by converting machine addresses to pointers . Procedures (subroutines not returning values) are a special case of function, with an empty return type void . Memory can be allocated to a program with calls to library routines . A preprocessor performs macro definition, source code file inclusion, and conditional compilation . There is a basic form of modularity : files can be compiled separately and linked together, with control over which functions and data objects are visible to other files via static and extern attributes. Complex functionality such as I/O , string manipulation, and mathematical functions are consistently delegated to library routines . The generated code after compilation has relatively straightforward needs on the underlying platform, which makes it suitable for creating operating systems and for use in embedded systems . While C does not include certain features found in other languages (such as object orientation and garbage collection ), these can be implemented or emulated, often through the use of external libraries (e.g., the GLib Object System or the Boehm garbage collector ). Relations to other languages [ edit ] Main article: List of C-family programming languages Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C , C , Unix's C shell , D , Go , Java , JavaScript (including transpilers ), Julia , Limbo , LPC , Objective-C , Perl , PHP , Python , Ruby , Rust , Swift , Verilog and SystemVerilog (hardware description languages). [ 5 ] These languages have drawn many of their control structures and other basic features from C. Most of them also express highly similar syntax to C, and they tend to combine the recognizable expression and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems, data models , and semantics that can be radically different. History [ edit ] Early developments [ edit ] Timeline of C language Year Informal name Official standard 1972 first release  1978 KR C  1989, 1990 ANSI C , C89, ISO C, C90 ANSI X3.159-1989 ISO/IEC 9899:1990 1999 C99 , C9X ISO/IEC 9899:1999 2011 C11 , C1X ISO/IEC 9899:2011 2018 C17 , C18 ISO/IEC 9899:2018 2024 C23 , C2X ISO/IEC 9899:2024 TBA C2Y The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a PDP-7 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson , incorporating several ideas from colleagues.  Eventually, they decided to port the operating system to a PDP-11 . The original PDP-11 version of Unix was also developed in assembly language. [ 9 ] B [ edit ] Main article: B (programming language) Thompson wanted a programming language for developing utilities for the new platform. He first tried writing a Fortran compiler, but he soon gave up the idea and instead created a cut-down version of the recently developed systems programming language called BCPL . The official description of BCPL was not available at the time, [ 14 ] and Thompson modified the syntax to be less 'wordy' and similar to a simplified ALGOL known as SMALGOL. [ 15 ] He called the result B , [ 9 ] describing it as ""BCPL semantics with a lot of SMALGOL syntax"". [ 15 ] Like BCPL, B had a bootstrapping compiler to facilitate porting to new machines. [ 15 ] Ultimately, few utilities were written in B because it was too slow and could not take advantage of PDP-11 features such as byte addressability. New B and first C release [ edit ] In 1971 Ritchie  started to improve B, to use the features of the more-powerful PDP-11.  A significant addition was a character data type.  He called this New B (NB). [ 15 ] Thompson started to use NB to write the Unix kernel, and his requirements shaped the direction of the language development. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Through to 1972, richer types were added to the NB language: NB had arrays of int and char . Pointers, the ability to generate pointers to other types, arrays of all types, and types to be returned from functions were all also added. Arrays within expressions became pointers. A new compiler was written, and the language was renamed C. [ 9 ] The C compiler and some utilities made with it were included in Version 2 Unix , which is also known as Research Unix . [ 17 ] Structures and Unix kernel re-write [ edit ] At Version 4 Unix , released in November 1973, the Unix kernel was extensively re-implemented in C. [ 9 ] By this time, the C language had acquired some powerful features such as struct types. The preprocessor was introduced around 1973 at the urging of Alan Snyder and also in recognition of the usefulness of the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I . Its original version provided only included files and simple string replacements: include and define of parameterless macros. Soon after that, it was extended, mostly by Mike Lesk and then by John Reiser, to incorporate macros with arguments and conditional compilation . [ 9 ] Unix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than assembly . Earlier instances include the Multics system (which was written in PL/I ) and Master Control Program (MCP) for the Burroughs B5000 (which was written in ALGOL ) in 1961. In around  1977, Ritchie and Stephen C. Johnson made further changes to the language to facilitate portability of the Unix operating system.  Johnson's Portable C Compiler served as the basis for several implementations of C on new platforms. [ 16 ] KR C [ edit ] The cover of the book The C Programming Language , first edition, by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie In 1978 Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language . [ 18 ] Known as KR from the initials of its authors, the book served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as "" KR C "". As this was released in 1978, it is now also referred to as C78 . [ 19 ] The second edition of the book [ 20 ] covers the later ANSI C standard, described below. KR introduced several language features: Standard I/O library long int data type unsigned int data type Compound assignment operators of the form  op (such as - ) were changed to the form op  (that is, - ) to remove the semantic ambiguity created by constructs such as i-10 , which had been interpreted as i - 10 (decrement i by 10) instead of the possibly intended i  -10 (let i be 10). Even after the publication of the 1989 ANSI standard, for many years KR C was still considered the "" lowest common denominator "" to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written KR C code can be legal Standard C as well. In early versions of C, only functions that return types other than int must be declared if used before the function definition; functions used without prior declaration were presumed to return type int . For example: long some_function (); / This is a function declaration, so the compiler can know the name and return type of this function. / / int / other_function (); / Another function declaration.  Because this is an early version of C, there is an implicit 'int' type here.  A comment shows where the explicit 'int' type specifier would be required in later versions. / / int / calling_function () / This is a function definition, including the body of the code following in the  curly brackets . Because no return type is specified, the function implicitly returns an 'int' in this early version of C. /  long test1 ; register / int / test2 ; / Again, note that 'int' is not required here. The 'int' type specifier / / in the comment would be required in later versions of C. / / The 'register' keyword indicates to the compiler that this variable should / / ideally be stored in a register as opposed to within the stack frame. / test1  some_function (); if ( test1  1 ) test2  0 ; else test2  other_function (); return test2 ;  The int type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted in KR C, but are required in later standards. Since KR function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter type checks were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if different calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments.  Separate tools such as Unix's lint utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files. In the years following the publication of KR C, several features were added to the language, supported by compilers from ATT (in particular PCC [ 21 ] ) and some other vendors. These included: void functions (i.e., functions with no return value) functions returning struct or union types (previously only a single pointer, integer or float could be returned) assignment for struct data types enumerated types (previously, preprocessor definitions for integer fixed values were used, e.g. define GREEN 3 ) The large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a standard library , together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the KR specification, led to the necessity of standardization. [ 22 ] ANSI C and ISO C [ edit ] Main article: ANSI C During the late 1970s and 1980s, versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of mainframe computers , minicomputers , and microcomputers , including the IBM PC , as its popularity began to increase significantly. In 1983 the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. X3J11 based the C standard on the Unix implementation; however, the non-portable portion of the Unix C library was handed off to the IEEE working group 1003 to become the basis for the 1988 POSIX standard. In 1989, the C standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 ""Programming Language C"".  This version of the language is often referred to as ANSI C , Standard C, or sometimes C89. In 1990 the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms ""C89"" and ""C90"" refer to the same programming language. ANSI, like other national standards bodies, no longer develops the C standard independently, but defers to the international C standard, maintained by the working group ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 /WG14.  National adoption of an update to the international standard typically occurs within a year of ISO publication. One of the aims of the C standardization process was to produce a superset of KR C, incorporating many of the subsequently introduced unofficial features. The standards committee also included several additional features such as function prototypes (borrowed from C), void pointers, support for international character sets and locales , and preprocessor enhancements. Although the syntax for parameter declarations was augmented to include the style used in C, the KR interface continued to be permitted, for compatibility with existing source code. C89 is supported by current C compilers, and most modern C code is based on it. Any program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any platform with a conforming C implementation, within its resource limits.  Without such precautions, programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as GUI libraries, or to a reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of data types and byte endianness . In cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming or KR C-based compilers, the __STDC__ macro can be used to split the code into Standard and KR sections to prevent the use on a KR C-based compiler of features available only in Standard C. After the ANSI/ISO standardization process, the C language specification remained relatively static for several years. In 1995, Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 C standard (ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, known informally as C95) was published, to correct some details and to add more extensive support for international character sets. [ 23 ] C99 [ edit ] Main article: C99 The C standard was further revised in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which is commonly referred to as "" C99 "". It has since been amended three times by Technical Corrigenda. [ 24 ] C99 introduced several new features, including inline functions , several new data types (including long long int and a complex type to represent complex numbers ), variable-length arrays and flexible array members , improved support for IEEE 754 floating point, support for variadic macros (macros of variable arity ), and support for one-line comments beginning with // , as in BCPL or C. Many of these had already been implemented as extensions in several C compilers. C99 is for the most part backward compatible with C90, but is stricter in some ways; in particular, a declaration that lacks a type specifier no longer has int implicitly assumed. A standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined with value 199901L to indicate that C99 support is available. GCC , Solaris Studio , and other C compilers now [ when? ] support many or all of the new features of C99. The C compiler in Microsoft Visual C , however, implements the C89 standard and those parts of C99 that are required for compatibility with C11 . [ 25 ] [ needs update ] In addition, the C99 standard requires support for identifiers using Unicode in the form of escaped characters (e.g. u0040 or U0001f431 ) and suggests support for raw Unicode names. C11 [ edit ] Main article: C11 (C standard revision) Work began in 2007 on another revision of the C standard, informally called ""C1X"" until its official publication of ISO/IEC 9899:2011 on December 8, 2011. The C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations. The C11 standard adds numerous new features to C and the library, including type generic macros, anonymous structures, improved Unicode support, atomic operations, multi-threading, and bounds-checked functions.  It also makes some portions of the existing C99 library optional, and improves compatibility with C. The standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 201112L to indicate that C11 support is available. C17 [ edit ] Main article: C17 (C standard revision) C17 is an informal name for ISO/IEC 9899:2018, a standard for the C programming language published in June 2018. It introduces no new language features, only technical corrections, and clarifications to defects in C11. The standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 201710L to indicate that C17 support is available. C23 [ edit ] Main article: C23 (C standard revision) C23 is an informal name for the current major C language standard revision. It was informally known as ""C2X"" through most of its development. C23 was published in October 2024 as ISO/IEC 9899:2024. [ 26 ] The standard macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 202311L to indicate that C23 support is available. C2Y [ edit ] C2Y is an informal name for the next major C language standard revision, after C23 (C2X), that is hoped to be released later in the 2020s decade, hence the '2' in ""C2Y"". An early working draft of C2Y was released in February 2024 as N3220 by the working group ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 /WG14. [ 27 ] Embedded C [ edit ] Main article: Embedded C Historically, embedded C programming requires non-standard extensions to the C language to support exotic features such as fixed-point arithmetic , multiple distinct memory banks , and basic I/O operations. In 2008, the C Standards Committee published a technical report extending the C language [ 28 ] to address these issues by providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and basic I/O hardware addressing. Syntax [ edit ] Main article: C syntax C has a formal grammar specified by the C standard. [ 29 ] Line endings are generally not significant in C; however, line boundaries do have significance during the preprocessing phase. Comments may appear either between the delimiters / and / , or (since C99) following // until the end of the line. Comments delimited by / and / do not nest, and these sequences of characters are not interpreted as comment delimiters if they appear inside string or character literals. [ 30 ] C source files contain declarations and function definitions. Function definitions, in turn, contain declarations and statements . Declarations either define new types using keywords such as struct , union , and enum , or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type followed by the variable name. Keywords such as char and int specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces (  and  , sometimes called ""curly brackets"") to limit the scope of declarations and to act as a single statement for control structures. As an imperative language, C uses statements to specify actions. The most common statement is an expression statement , consisting of an expression to be evaluated, followed by a semicolon; as a side effect of the evaluation, functions may be called and variables assigned new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, C provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured programming is supported by if ... [ else ] conditional execution and by do ... while , while , and for iterative execution (looping). The for statement has separate initialization, testing, and reinitialization expressions, any or all of which can be omitted. break and continue can be used within the loop. Break is used to leave the innermost enclosing loop statement and continue is used to skip to its reinitialisation. There is also a non-structured goto statement which branches directly to the designated label within the function. switch selects a case to be executed based on the value of an integer expression. Different from many other languages, control-flow will fall through to the next case unless terminated by a break . Expressions can use a variety of built-in operators and may contain function calls. The order in which arguments to functions and operands to most operators are evaluated is unspecified. The evaluations may even be interleaved. However, all side effects (including storage to variables) will occur before the next "" sequence point ""; sequence points include the end of each expression statement, and the entry to and return from each function call.  Sequence points also occur during evaluation of expressions containing certain operators (  ,  , ?: and the comma operator ). This permits a high degree of object code optimization by the compiler, but requires C programmers to take more care to obtain reliable results than is needed for other programming languages. Kernighan and Ritchie say in the Introduction of The C Programming Language : ""C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better."" [ 31 ] The C standard did not attempt to correct many of these blemishes, because of the impact of such changes on already existing software. Character set [ edit ] The basic C source character set includes the following characters: Lowercase and uppercase letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet : a  z , A  Z Decimal digits: 0  9 Graphic characters: ! ""    ' ( )   , - . / : ;    ? [  ]  _     Whitespace characters : space , horizontal tab , vertical tab , form feed , newline The newline character indicates the end of a text line; it need not correspond to an actual single character, although for convenience C treats it as such. Additional multi-byte encoded characters may be used in string literals , but they are not entirely portable . Since C99 multi-national Unicode characters can be embedded portably within C source text by using uXXXX or UXXXXXXXX encoding (where X denotes a hexadecimal character). The basic C execution character set contains the same characters, along with representations for alert , backspace , and carriage return . Run-time support for extended character sets has increased with each revision of the C standard. Reserved words [ edit ] The following reserved words are case sensitive . C89 has 32 reserved words, also known as 'keywords', which cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined: auto break case char const continue default do double else enum extern float for goto if int long register return short signed sizeof static struct switch typedef union unsigned void volatile while C99 added five more reserved words: ( indicates an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword) inline restrict _Bool  _Complex _Imaginary C11 added seven more reserved words: [ 32 ] ( indicates an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword) _Alignas  _Alignof  _Atomic _Generic _Noreturn _Static_assert  _Thread_local  C23 reserved fifteen more words: alignas alignof bool constexpr false nullptr static_assert thread_local true typeof typeof_unqual _BitInt _Decimal32 _Decimal64 _Decimal128 Most of the recently reserved words begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter, because identifiers of that form were previously reserved by the C standard for use only by implementations.  Since existing program source code should not have been using these identifiers, it would not be affected when C implementations started supporting these extensions to the programming language. Some standard headers do define more convenient synonyms for underscored identifiers. Some of those words were added as keywords with their conventional spelling in C23 and the corresponding macros were removed. Prior to C89, entry was reserved as a keyword. In the second edition of their book The C Programming Language , which describes what became known as C89, Kernighan and Ritchie wrote, ""The ... [keyword] entry , formerly reserved but never used, is no longer reserved."" and ""The stillborn entry keyword is withdrawn."" [ 33 ] Operators [ edit ] Main article: Operators in C and C C supports a rich set of operators , which are symbols used within an expression to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for: arithmetic :  , - ,  , / ,  assignment :  augmented assignment :  , - ,  , / ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  bitwise logic :  ,  ,  ,  bitwise shifts :  ,  Boolean logic : ! ,  ,  conditional evaluation : ? : equality testing:  , ! calling functions : ( ) increment and decrement :  , -- member selection : . , - object size: sizeof type: typeof , typeof_unqual since C23 order relations :  ,  ,  ,  reference and dereference :  ,  , [ ] sequencing: , subexpression grouping : ( ) type conversion : ( typename ) C uses the operator  (used in mathematics to express equality) to indicate assignment, following the precedent of Fortran and PL/I , but unlike ALGOL and its derivatives. C uses the operator  to test for equality. The similarity between the operators for assignment and equality may result in the accidental use of one in place of the other, and in many cases the mistake does not produce an error message (although some compilers produce warnings). For example, the conditional expression if (a  b  1) might mistakenly be written as if (a  b  1) , which will be evaluated as true unless the value of a is 0 after the assignment. [ 34 ] The C operator precedence is not always intuitive. For example, the operator  binds more tightly than (is executed prior to) the operators  (bitwise AND) and  (bitwise OR) in expressions such as x  1  0 , which must be written as (x  1)  0 if that is the coder's intent. [ 35 ] ""Hello, world"" example [ edit ] See also: ""Hello, World!"" program ""Hello, World!"" program by Brian Kernighan (1978) The ""hello, world"" example that appeared in the first edition of KR has become the model for an introductory program in most programming textbooks. The program prints ""hello, world"" to the standard output , which is usually a terminal or screen display. The original version was: [ 36 ] main ()  printf ( ""hello, world n "" );  A standard-conforming ""hello, world"" program is: [ a ] include stdio.h int main ( void )  printf ( ""hello, world n "" );  The first line of the program contains a preprocessing directive , indicated by include . This causes the compiler to replace that line of code with the entire text of the stdio.h header file, which contains declarations for standard input and output functions such as printf and scanf . The angle brackets surrounding stdio.h indicate that the header file can be located using a search strategy that prefers headers provided with the compiler to other headers having the same name (as opposed to double quotes which typically include local or project-specific header files). The second line indicates that a function named main is being defined. The main function serves a special purpose in C programs; the run-time environment calls the main function to begin program execution. The type specifier int indicates that the value returned to the invoker (in this case the run-time environment) as a result of evaluating the main function, is an integer. The keyword void as a parameter list indicates that the main function takes no arguments. [ b ] The opening curly brace indicates the beginning of the code that defines the main function. The next line of the program is a statement that calls (i.e. diverts execution to) a function named printf , which in this case is supplied from a system library . In this call, the printf function is passed (i.e. provided with) a single argument, which is the address of the first character in the string literal ""hello, worldn"" . The string literal is an unnamed array set up automatically by the compiler, with elements of type char and a final NULL character (ASCII value 0) marking the end of the array (to allow printf to determine the length of the string). The NULL character can also be written as the escape sequence 0 . The n is a standard escape sequence that C translates to a newline character, which, on output, signifies the end of the current line. The return value of the printf function is of type int , but it is silently discarded since it is not used. (A more careful program might test the return value to check that the printf function succeeded.) The semicolon ; terminates the statement. The closing curly brace indicates the end of the code for the main function. According to the C99 specification and newer, the main function (unlike any other function) will implicitly return a value of 0 upon reaching the  that terminates the function. [ c ] The return value of 0 is interpreted by the run-time system as an exit code indicating successful execution of the function. [ 37 ] Data types [ edit ] Main article: C data types This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( October 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The type system in C is static and weakly typed , which makes it similar to the type system of ALGOL descendants such as Pascal . [ 38 ] There are built-in types for integers of various sizes, both signed and unsigned, floating-point numbers , and enumerated types ( enum ).  Integer type char is often used for single-byte characters.  C99 added a Boolean data type .  There are also derived types including arrays , pointers , records ( struct ), and unions ( union ). C is often used in low-level systems programming where escapes from the type system may be necessary.  The compiler attempts to ensure type correctness of most expressions, but the programmer can override the checks in various ways, either by using a type cast to explicitly convert a value from one type to another, or by using pointers or unions to reinterpret the underlying bits of a data object in some other way. Some find C's declaration syntax unintuitive, particularly for function pointers . (Ritchie's idea was to declare identifiers in contexts resembling their use: "" declaration reflects use "".) [ 39 ] C's usual arithmetic conversions allow for efficient code to be generated, but can sometimes produce unexpected results.  For example, a comparison of signed and unsigned integers of equal width requires a conversion of the signed value to unsigned.  This can generate unexpected results if the signed value is negative. Pointers [ edit ] C supports the use of pointers , a type of reference that records the address or location of an object or function in memory.  Pointers can be dereferenced to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function.  Pointers can be manipulated using assignment or pointer arithmetic .  The run-time representation of a pointer value is typically a raw memory address (perhaps augmented by an offset-within-word field), but since a pointer's type includes the type of the thing pointed to, expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time.  Pointer arithmetic is automatically scaled by the size of the pointed-to data type. Pointers are used for many purposes in C. Text strings are commonly manipulated using pointers into arrays of characters. Dynamic memory allocation is performed using pointers; the result of a malloc is usually cast to the data type of the data to be stored.  Many data types, such as trees , are commonly implemented as dynamically allocated struct objects linked together using pointers. Pointers to other pointers are often used in multi-dimensional arrays and arrays of struct objects.  Pointers to functions ( function pointers ) are useful for passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions (such as qsort or bsearch ), in dispatch tables , or as callbacks to event handlers . [ 37 ] A null pointer value explicitly points to no valid location. Dereferencing a null pointer value is undefined, often resulting in a segmentation fault .  Null pointer values are useful for indicating special cases such as no ""next"" pointer in the final node of a linked list , or as an error indication from functions returning pointers.  In appropriate contexts in source code, such as for assigning to a pointer variable, a null pointer constant can be written as 0 , with or without explicit casting to a pointer type, as the NULL macro defined by several standard headers or, since C23 with the constant nullptr .  In conditional contexts, null pointer values evaluate to false , while all other pointer values evaluate to true . Void pointers ( void  ) point to objects of unspecified type, and can therefore be used as ""generic"" data pointers. Since the size and type of the pointed-to object is not known, void pointers cannot be dereferenced, nor is pointer arithmetic on them allowed, although they can easily be (and in many contexts implicitly are) converted to and from any other object pointer type. [ 37 ] Careless use of pointers is potentially dangerous.  Because they are typically unchecked, a pointer variable can be made to point to any arbitrary location, which can cause undesirable effects.  Although properly used pointers point to safe places, they can be made to point to unsafe places by using invalid pointer arithmetic ; the objects they point to may continue to be used after deallocation ( dangling pointers ); they may be used without having been initialized ( wild pointers ); or they may be directly assigned an unsafe value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer.  In general, C is permissive in allowing manipulation of and conversion between pointer types, although compilers typically provide options for various levels of checking. Some other programming languages address these problems by using more restrictive reference types. Arrays [ edit ] See also: C string handling Array types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time. The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays.  However, it is also possible to allocate a block of memory (of arbitrary size) at run-time, using the standard library's malloc function, and treat it as an array. Since arrays are always accessed (in effect) via pointers, array accesses are typically not checked against the underlying array size, although some compilers may provide bounds checking as an option. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Array bounds violations are therefore possible and can lead to various repercussions, including illegal memory accesses, corruption of data, buffer overruns , and run-time exceptions. C does not have a special provision for declaring multi-dimensional arrays , but rather relies on recursion within the type system to declare arrays of arrays, which effectively accomplishes the same thing.  The index values of the resulting ""multi-dimensional array"" can be thought of as increasing in row-major order . Multi-dimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied linear algebra ) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is well suited to this particular task. However, in early versions of C the bounds of the array must be known fixed values or else explicitly passed to any subroutine that requires them, and dynamically sized arrays of arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing. (A workaround for this was to allocate the array with an additional ""row vector"" of pointers to the columns.) C99 introduced ""variable-length arrays"" which address this issue. The following example using modern C (C99 or later) shows allocation of a two-dimensional array on the heap and the use of multi-dimensional array indexing for accesses (which can use bounds-checking on many C compilers): int func ( int N , int M )  float (  p )[ N ] [ M ]  malloc ( sizeof  p ); if ( p  0 ) return -1 ; for ( int i  0 ; i  N ; i  ) for ( int j  0 ; j  M ; j  ) (  p )[ i ] [ j ]  i  j ; print_array ( N , M , p ); free ( p ); return 1 ;  And here is a similar implementation using C99's Auto VLA feature: [ d ] int func ( int N , int M )  // Caution: checks should be made to ensure NMsizeof(float) does NOT exceed limitations for auto VLAs and is within available size of stack. float p [ N ] [ M ]; // auto VLA is held on the stack, and sized when the function is invoked for ( int i  0 ; i  N ; i  ) for ( int j  0 ; j  M ; j  ) p [ i ] [ j ]  i  j ; print_array ( N , M , p ); // no need to free(p) since it will disappear when the function exits, along with the rest of the stack frame return 1 ;  Arraypointer interchangeability [ edit ] The subscript notation x[i] (where x designates a pointer) is syntactic sugar for (xi) . [ 42 ] Taking advantage of the compiler's knowledge of the pointer type, the address that x  i points to is not the base address (pointed to by x ) incremented by i bytes, but rather is defined to be the base address incremented by i multiplied by the size of an element that x points to.  Thus, x[i] designates the i1 th element of the array. Furthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of sizeof ), an expression of array type is automatically converted to a pointer to the array's first element. This implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use pass-by-value semantics, arrays are in effect passed by reference . The total size of an array x can be determined by applying sizeof to an expression of array type. The size of an element can be determined by applying the operator sizeof to any dereferenced element of an array A , as in n  sizeof A[0] . Thus, the number of elements in a declared array A can be determined as sizeof A / sizeof A[0] . Note, that if only a pointer to the first element is available as it is often the case in C code because of the automatic conversion described above, the information about the full type of the array and its length are lost. Memory management [ edit ] One of the most important functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing memory and the objects that are stored in memory. C provides three principal ways to allocate memory for objects: [ 37 ] Static memory allocation : space for the object is provided in the binary at compile-time; these objects have an extent (or lifetime) as long as the binary which contains them is loaded into memory. Automatic memory allocation : temporary objects can be stored on the stack , and this space is automatically freed and reusable after the block in which they are declared is exited. Dynamic memory allocation : blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library functions such as malloc from a region of memory called the heap ; these blocks persist until subsequently freed for reuse by calling the library function realloc or free . These three approaches are appropriate in different situations and have various trade-offs. For example, static memory allocation has little allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially have a great deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. The persistent nature of static objects is useful for maintaining state information across function calls, automatic allocation is easy to use but stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time. Most C programs make extensive use of all three. Where possible, automatic or static allocation is usually simplest because the storage is managed by the compiler, freeing the programmer of the potentially error-prone chore of manually allocating and releasing storage. However, many data structures can change in size at runtime, and since static allocations (and automatic allocations before C99) must have a fixed size at compile-time, there are many situations in which dynamic allocation is necessary. [ 37 ] Prior to the C99 standard, variable-sized arrays were a common example of this. (See the article on C dynamic memory allocation for an example of dynamically allocated arrays.) Unlike automatic allocation, which can fail at run time with uncontrolled consequences, the dynamic allocation functions return an indication (in the form of a null pointer value) when the required storage cannot be allocated.  (Static allocation that is too large is usually detected by the linker or loader , before the program can even begin execution.) Unless otherwise specified, static objects contain zero or null pointer values upon program startup. Automatically and dynamically allocated objects are initialized only if an initial value is explicitly specified; otherwise they initially have indeterminate values (typically, whatever bit pattern happens to be present in the storage , which might not even represent a valid value for that type). If the program attempts to access an uninitialized value, the results are undefined. Many modern compilers try to detect and warn about this problem, but both false positives and false negatives can occur. Heap memory allocation has to be synchronized with its actual usage in any program to be reused as much as possible. For example, if the only pointer to a heap memory allocation goes out of scope or has its value overwritten before it is deallocated explicitly, then that memory cannot be recovered for later reuse and is essentially lost to the program, a phenomenon known as a memory leak . Conversely, it is possible for memory to be freed, but is referenced subsequently, leading to unpredictable results. Typically, the failure symptoms appear in a portion of the program unrelated to the code that causes the error, making it difficult to diagnose the failure. Such issues are ameliorated in languages with automatic garbage collection . Libraries [ edit ] The C programming language uses libraries as its primary method of extension. In C, a library is a set of functions contained within a single ""archive"" file.  Each library typically has a header file , which contains the prototypes of the functions contained within the library that may be used by a program, and declarations of special data types and macro symbols used with these functions. For a program to use a library, it must include the library's header file, and the library must be linked with the program, which in many cases requires compiler flags (e.g., -lm , shorthand for ""link the math library""). [ 37 ] The most common C library is the C standard library , which is specified by the ISO and ANSI C standards and comes with every C implementation (implementations which target limited environments such as embedded systems may provide only a subset of the standard library). This library supports stream input and output, memory allocation, mathematics, character strings, and time values.  Several separate standard headers (for example, stdio.h ) specify the interfaces for these and other standard library facilities. Another common set of C library functions are those used by applications specifically targeted for Unix and Unix-like systems, especially functions which provide an interface to the kernel . These functions are detailed in various standards such as POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification . Since many programs have been written in C, there are a wide variety of other libraries available. Libraries are often written in C because C compilers generate efficient object code ; programmers then create interfaces to the library so that the routines can be used from higher-level languages like Java , Perl , and Python . [ 37 ] File handling and streams [ edit ] File input and output (I/O) is not part of the C language itself but instead is handled by libraries (such as the C standard library) and their associated header files (e.g. stdio.h ). File handling is generally implemented through high-level I/O which works through streams . A stream is from this perspective a data flow that is independent of devices, while a file is a concrete device. The high-level I/O is done through the association of a stream to a file. In the C standard library, a buffer (a memory area or queue) is temporarily used to store data before it is sent to the final destination. This reduces the time spent waiting for slower devices, for example a hard drive or solid-state drive . Low-level I/O functions are not part of the standard C library [ clarification needed ] but are generally part of ""bare metal"" programming (programming that is independent of any operating system such as most embedded programming ). With few exceptions, implementations include low-level I/O. Language tools [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( July 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A number of tools have been developed to help C programmers find and fix statements with undefined behavior or possibly erroneous expressions, with greater rigor than that provided by the compiler. Automated source code checking and auditing tools exist, such as Lint . A common practice is to use Lint to detect questionable code when a program is first written. Once a program passes Lint, it is then compiled using the C compiler. Also, many compilers can optionally warn about syntactically valid constructs that are likely to actually be errors. MISRA C is a proprietary set of guidelines to avoid such questionable code, developed for embedded systems. [ 43 ] There are also compilers, libraries, and operating system level mechanisms for performing actions that are not a standard part of C, such as bounds checking for arrays, detection of buffer overflow , serialization , dynamic memory tracking, and automatic garbage collection . Memory management checking tools like Purify or Valgrind and linking with libraries containing special versions of the memory allocation functions can help uncover runtime errors in memory usage. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Uses [ edit ] Rationale for use in systems programming [ edit ] Some software written in C C is widely used for systems programming in implementing operating systems and embedded system applications. [ 46 ] This is for several reasons: The C language permits platform hardware and memory to be accessed with pointers and type punning , so system-specific features (e.g. Control/Status Registers , I/O registers ) can be configured and used with code written in C  it allows fullest control of the platform it is running on. The code generated after compilation does not demand many system features , and can be invoked from some boot code in a straightforward manner  it is simple to execute. The C language statements and expressions typically map well on to sequences of instructions for the target processor, and consequently there is a low run-time demand on system resources  it is fast to execute. With its rich set of operators, the C language can use many of the features of target CPUs.  Where a particular CPU has more esoteric instructions, a language variant can be constructed with perhaps intrinsic functions to exploit those instructions  it can use practically all the target CPU's features. The language makes it easy to overlay structures onto blocks of binary data, allowing the data to be comprehended, navigated and modified  it can write data structures, even file systems. The language supports a rich set of operators, including bit manipulation, for integer arithmetic and logic, and perhaps different sizes of floating point numbers  it can process appropriately-structured data effectively. C is a fairly small language, with only a handful of statements, and without too many features that generate extensive target code  it is comprehensible. C has direct control over memory allocation and deallocation, which gives reasonable efficiency and predictable timing to memory-handling operations, without any concerns for sporadic stop-the-world garbage collection events  it has predictable performance. C permits the use and implementation of different memory allocation schemes, including a typical malloc and free ; a more sophisticated mechanism with arenas ; or a version for an OS kernel that may suit DMA , use within interrupt handlers , or integrated with the virtual memory system. Depending on the linker and environment, C code can also call libraries written in assembly language , and may be called from assembly language  it interoperates well with other lower-level code. C and its calling conventions and linker structures are commonly used in conjunction with other high-level languages, with calls both to C and from C supported  it interoperates well with other high-level code. C has a very mature and broad ecosystem, including libraries, frameworks, open source compilers, debuggers and utilities, and is the de facto standard. It is likely the drivers already exist in C, or that there is a similar CPU architecture as a back-end of a C compiler, so there is reduced incentive to choose another language. Used for computationally-intensive libraries [ edit ] C enables programmers to create efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures, because the layer of abstraction from hardware is thin, and its overhead is low, an important criterion for computationally intensive programs. For example, the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library , the GNU Scientific Library , Mathematica , and MATLAB are completely or partially written in C.  Many languages support calling library functions in C, for example, the Python -based framework NumPy uses C for the high-performance and hardware-interacting aspects. Games [ edit ] Computer games are often built from a combination of languages. C has featured significantly, especially for those games attempting to obtain best performance from computer platforms.  Examples include Doom from 1993. [ 47 ] C as an intermediate language [ edit ] C is sometimes used as an intermediate language by implementations of other languages. This approach may be used for portability or convenience; by using C as an intermediate language, additional machine-specific code generators are not necessary.  C has some features, such as line-number preprocessor directives and optional superfluous commas at the end of initializer lists, that support compilation of generated code. However, some of C's shortcomings have prompted the development of other C-based languages specifically designed for use as intermediate languages, such as C-- . Also, contemporary major compilers GCC and LLVM both feature an intermediate representation that is not C, and those compilers support front ends for many languages including C. Other languages written in C [ edit ] A consequence of C's wide availability and efficiency is that compilers , libraries and interpreters of other programming languages are often implemented in C. [ 48 ] For example, the reference implementations of Python , [ 49 ] Perl , [ 50 ] Ruby , [ 51 ] and PHP [ 52 ] are written in C. Once used for web development [ edit ] Historically, C was sometimes used for web development using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) as a ""gateway"" for information between the web application, the server, and the browser. [ 53 ] C may have been chosen over interpreted languages because of its speed, stability, and near-universal availability. [ 54 ] It is no longer common practice for web development to be done in C, [ 55 ] and many other web development languages are popular.  Applications where C-based web development continues include the HTTP configuration pages on routers , IoT devices and similar, although even here some projects have parts in higher-level languages e.g. the use of Lua within OpenWRT . Web servers [ edit ] The two most popular web servers , Apache HTTP Server and Nginx , are both written in C.  These web servers interact with the operating system, listen on TCP ports for HTTP requests, and then serve up static web content, or cause the execution of other languages handling to 'render' content such as PHP , which is itself primarily written in C.  C's close-to-the-metal approach allows for the construction of these high-performance software systems. End-user applications [ edit ] C has also been widely used to implement end-user applications. [ 56 ] However, such applications can also be written in newer, higher-level languages. Limitations [ edit ] the power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language  Dennis Ritchie [ 57 ] While C has been popular, influential and hugely successful, it has drawbacks, including: The standard dynamic memory handling with malloc and free is error prone. Improper use can lead to memory leaks and dangling pointers . [ 58 ] The use of pointers and the direct manipulation of memory means corruption of memory is possible, perhaps due to programmer error, or insufficient checking of bad data. There is some type checking , but it does not apply to areas like variadic functions , and the type checking can be trivially or inadvertently circumvented.  It is weakly typed . Since the code generated by the compiler contains few checks itself, there is a burden on the programmer to consider all possible outcomes, to protect against buffer overruns, array bounds checking, stack overflows , memory exhaustion, and consider race conditions , thread isolation, etc. The use of pointers and the run-time manipulation of these means there may be two ways to access the same data (aliasing), which is not determinable at compile time.  This means that some optimisations that may be available to other languages are not possible in C.  FORTRAN is considered faster. Some of the standard library functions, e.g. scanf or strncat , can lead to buffer overruns . There is limited standardisation in support for low-level variants in generated code, for example: different function calling conventions and ABI ; different structure packing conventions; different byte ordering within larger integers (including endianness).  In many language implementations, some of these options may be handled with the preprocessor directive pragma , [ 59 ] [ 60 ] and some with additional keywords e.g. use __cdecl calling convention.  The directive and options are not consistently supported. [ 61 ] String handling using the standard library is code-intensive, with explicit memory management required. The language does not directly support object orientation, introspection , run-time expression evaluation, generics, etc. There are few guards against inappropriate use of language features, which may lead to unmaintainable code.  In particular, the C preprocessor can hide troubling effects such as double evaluation and worse. [ 62 ] This facility for tricky code has been celebrated with competitions such as the International Obfuscated C Code Contest and the Underhanded C Contest . C lacks standard support for exception handling and only offers return codes for error checking. The setjmp and longjmp standard library functions have been used [ 63 ] to implement a try-catch mechanism via macros. For some purposes, restricted styles of C have been adopted, e.g. MISRA C or CERT C , in an attempt to reduce the opportunity for bugs.  Databases such as CWE attempt to count the ways C etc. has vulnerabilities, along with recommendations for mitigation. There are tools that can mitigate against some of the drawbacks.  Contemporary C compilers include checks which may generate warnings to help identify many potential bugs. Related languages [ edit ] The TIOBE index graph, showing a comparison of the popularity of various programming languages [ 64 ] Main article: List of C-family programming languages C has both directly and indirectly influenced many later languages such as C and Java . [ 65 ] The most pervasive influence has been syntactical; all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression syntax of C with type systems, data models or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically. Several C or near-C interpreters exist, including Ch and CINT , which can also be used for scripting. When object-oriented programming languages became popular, C and Objective-C were two different extensions of C that provided object-oriented capabilities. Both languages were originally implemented as source-to-source compilers ; source code was translated into C, and then compiled with a C compiler. [ 66 ] The C programming language (originally named ""C with Classes "") was devised by Bjarne Stroustrup as an approach to providing object-oriented functionality with a C-like syntax. [ 67 ] C adds greater typing strength, scoping, and other tools useful in object-oriented programming, and permits generic programming via templates. Nearly a superset of C, C now [ when? ] supports most of C, with a few exceptions . Objective-C was originally a very ""thin"" layer on top of C, and remains a strict superset of C that permits object-oriented programming using a hybrid dynamic/static typing paradigm. Objective-C derives its syntax from both C and Smalltalk : syntax that involves preprocessing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls is inherited from C, while the syntax for object-oriented features was originally taken from Smalltalk. In addition to C and Objective-C , Ch , Cilk , and Unified Parallel C are nearly supersets of C. See also [ edit ] Computer programming portal Free and open-source software portal Compatibility of C and C Comparison of Pascal and C Comparison of programming languages International Obfuscated C Code Contest List of C-family programming languages List of C compilers Notes [ edit ]  The original example code will compile on most modern compilers that are not in strict standard compliance mode, but it does not fully conform to the requirements of either C89 or C99. In fact, C99 requires that a diagnostic message be produced.  The main function actually has two arguments, int argc and char argv[] , respectively, which can be used to handle command-line arguments .  The ISO C standard (section 5.1.2.2.1) requires both forms of main to be supported, which is special treatment not afforded to any other function.  Prior to C99, an explicit return 0; statement was required at the end of the main function.  Code of print_array (not shown) slightly differs, [ why? ] too.

All listed operators are in C and lacking indication otherwise, in C as well. Some tables include a ""In C"" column that indicates whether an operator is also in C. Note that C does not support operator overloading . When not overloaded, for the operators  ,  , and , (the comma operator ), there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the first operand. Most of the operators available in C and C are also available in other C-family languages such as C , D , Java , Perl , and PHP with the same precedence, associativity, and semantics. Many operators specified by a sequence of symbols are commonly referred to by a name that consists of the name of each symbol. For example,  and - are often called ""plus equal(s)"" and ""minus equal(s)"", instead of the more verbose ""assignment by addition"" and ""assignment by subtraction"". Operators [ edit ] In the following tables, lower case letters such as a and b represent literal values, object/variable names, or l-values, as appropriate. R , S and T stand for a data type, and K for a class or enumeration type. Some operators have alternative spellings using digraphs and trigraphs or operator synonyms . Arithmetic [ edit ] C and C have the same arithmetic operators and all can be overloaded in C. Operation Syntax C prototype in class K outside class Addition a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); Subtraction a - b R K :: operator - ( S b ); R operator - ( K a , S b ); Unary plus; integer promotion  a R K :: operator  (); R operator  ( K a ); Unary minus; additive inverse - a R K :: operator - (); R operator - ( K a ); Multiplication a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); Division a / b R K :: operator / ( S b ); R operator / ( K a , S b ); Modulo [ a ] a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); Prefix increment  a R  K :: operator  (); R  operator  ( K  a ); Postfix increment a  R K :: operator  ( int ); [ b ] R operator  ( K  a , int ); [ b ] Prefix decrement -- a R  K :: operator -- (); R  operator -- ( K  a ); Postfix decrement a -- R K :: operator -- ( int ); [ b ] R operator -- ( K  a , int ); [ b ] Relational [ edit ] All relational (comparison) operators can be overloaded in C. Since C20 , the inequality operator is automatically generated if operator is defined and all four relational operators are automatically generated if operator is defined. [ 1 ] Operation Syntax In C C prototype in class K outside class Equal to a  b Yes bool K :: operator  ( S const  b ) const ; bool operator  ( K const  a , S const  b ); Not equal to a ! b Yes bool K :: operator ! ( S const  b ) const ; bool operator !

Note that overloading logical AND and OR is discouraged, because as overloaded operators they always evaluate both operands instead of providing the normal semantics of short-circuit evaluation . [ 2 ] Operation Syntax C prototype in class K outside class NOT ! a bool K :: operator ! (); bool operator ! ( K a ); AND a  b bool K :: operator  ( S b ); bool operator  ( K a , S b ); OR a  b bool K :: operator  ( S b ); bool operator  ( K a , S b ); Bitwise [ edit ] C and C have the same bitwise operators and all can be overloaded in C. Operation Syntax C prototype in class K outside class NOT  a R K :: operator  (); R operator  ( K a ); AND a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); OR a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); XOR a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); Shift left [ e ] a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); Shift right [ e ] [ f ] a  b R K :: operator  ( S b ); R operator  ( K a , S b ); Assignment [ edit ] C and C have the same assignment operators and all can be overloaded in C. For the combination operators, a  b (where  represents an operation) is equivalent to a  a  b , except that a is evaluated only once. Operation Syntax C prototype in class K outside class Assignment a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b );  Addition combination a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Subtraction combination a - b R  K :: operator - ( S b ); R  operator - ( K  a , S b ); Multiplication combination a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Division combination a / b R  K :: operator / ( S b ); R  operator / ( K  a , S b ); Modulo combination a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Bitwise AND combination a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Bitwise OR combination a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Bitwise XOR combination a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Bitwise left shift combination a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Bitwise right shift combination [ g ] a  b R  K :: operator  ( S b ); R  operator  ( K  a , S b ); Member and pointer [ edit ] Operation Syntax Can overload In C C prototype in class K outside class Subscript a [ b ] a : b : [ 4 ] Yes Yes R  K :: operator []( S b ); R  K :: operator []( S b , ...); [ h ]  Indirection (object pointed to by a )  a Yes Yes R  K :: operator  (); R  operator  ( K a ); Address-of (address of a )  a Yes [ i ] Yes R  K :: operator  (); R  operator  ( K a ); Structure dereference (member b of object pointed to by a ) a - b Yes Yes R  K :: operator - (); [ j ]  Structure reference (member b of object a ) a . b No Yes  Member selected by pointer-to-member b of object pointed to by a [ k ] a - b Yes No R  K :: operator - ( S b ); R  operator - ( K a , S b ); Member of object a selected by pointer-to-member b a . b No No  Other [ edit ] Operation Syntax Can overload In C C prototype in class K outside class Function call a ( a1, a2 ) Yes Yes R K::operator ()( S a , T b , ...);  Comma a , b Yes Yes R K :: operator ,( S b ); R operator ,( K a , S b ); Ternary conditional a ? b : c No Yes  Scope resolution a :: b [ l ] No No  User-defined literals [ m ] [ n ] ""a""_b Yes No  R operator """" _b ( T a ) Sizeof sizeof a [ o ] sizeof (R) No Yes  Size of parameter pack [ n ] sizeof...

For example, (a  0 and not flag) and (a  0  !flag) specify the same behavior. As another example, the bitand keyword may be used to replace not only the bitwise-and operator but also the address-of operator, and it can be used to specify reference types (e.g., int bitand ref  n ). The ISO C specification makes allowance for these keywords as preprocessor macros in the header file iso646.h . For compatibility with C, C also provides the header iso646.h , the inclusion of which has no effect. Until C20, it also provided the corresponding header ciso646 which had no effect as well. Expression evaluation order [ edit ] During expression evaluation, the order in which sub-expressions are evaluated is determined by precedence and associativity . An operator with higher precedence is evaluated before a operator of lower precedence and the operands of an operator are evaluated based on associativity. The following table describes the precedence and associativity of the C and C operators. Operators are shown in groups of equal precedence with groups ordered in descending precedence from top to bottom (lower order is higher precedence). [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Operator precedence is not affected by overloading. Order Operator Description Associativity 1 highest :: Scope resolution (C only) None 2  Postfix increment Left-to-right -- Postfix decrement () Function call [] Array subscripting .

The ternary operator allows any arbitrary expression as its middle operand, despite being listed as having higher precedence than the assignment and comma operators. Thus a ? b, c : d is interpreted as a ? (b, c) : d , and not as the meaningless (a ? b), (c : d) . So, the expression in the middle of the conditional operator (between ? and : ) is parsed as if parenthesized. Also, the immediate, un-parenthesized result of a C cast expression cannot be the operand of sizeof . Therefore, sizeof (int)  x is interpreted as (sizeof(int))  x and not sizeof ((int)  x) . Chained expressions [ edit ] The precedence table determines the order of binding in chained expressions, when it is not expressly specified by parentheses. For example, x3 is ambiguous without some precedence rule(s). The precedence table tells us that: x is 'bound' more tightly to  than to  , so that whatever  does (now or latersee below), it does it ONLY to x (and not to x3 ); it is equivalent to ( x , x3 ). Similarly, with 3x , where though the post-fix  is designed to act AFTER the entire expression is evaluated, the precedence table makes it clear that ONLY x gets incremented (and NOT 3x ). In fact, the expression ( tmpx , 3tmp ) is evaluated with tmp being a temporary value. It is functionally equivalent to something like ( tmp3x , x , tmp ). Precedence and bindings Abstracting the issue of precedence or binding, consider the diagram above for the expression 32y[i]. The compiler's job is to resolve the diagram into an expression, one in which several unary operators (call them 3( . ), 2( . ), ( . ) and ( . )[ i ]) are competing to bind to y. The order of precedence table resolves the final sub-expression they each act upon: ( . )[ i ] acts only on y, ( . ) acts only on y[i], 2( . ) acts only on y[i] and 3( . ) acts 'only' on 2((y[i])). It is important to note that WHAT sub-expression gets acted on by each operator is clear from the precedence table but WHEN each operator acts is not resolved by the precedence table; in this example, the ( . ) operator acts only on y[i] by the precedence rules but binding levels alone do not indicate the timing of the postfix  (the ( . ) operator acts only after y[i] is evaluated in the expression). Binding [ edit ] The binding of operators in C and C is specified by a factored language grammar, rather than a precedence table. This creates some subtle conflicts. For example, in C, the syntax for a conditional expression is: logical - OR - expression ? expression : conditional - expression while in C it is: logical - OR - expression ? expression : assignment - expression Hence, the expression: e  a  d ? a : a  d is parsed differently in the two languages. In C, this expression is a syntax error, because the syntax for an assignment expression in C is: unary - expression '' assignment - expression In C, it is parsed as: e  ( a  d ? a  : ( a  d )) which is a valid expression. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] To use the comma operator in a function call argument expression, variable assignment, or a comma-separated list, use of parentheses is required. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] For example, int a  1 , b  2 , weirdVariable  (  a , b ), d  4 ; Criticism of bitwise and equality operators precedence [ edit ] The precedence of the bitwise logical operators has been criticized. [ 15 ] Conceptually,  and  are arithmetic operators like  and . The expression a  b  7 is syntactically parsed as a  ( b  7 ) whereas the expression a  b  7 is parsed as ( a  b )  7 . This requires parentheses to be used more often than they otherwise would. Historically, there was no syntactic distinction between the bitwise and logical operators. In BCPL , B and early C, the operators   didn't exist. Instead   had different meaning depending on whether they are used in a 'truth-value context' (i.e. when a Boolean value was expected, for example in if ( a  b  c ) ... it behaved as a logical operator, but in c  a  b it behaved as a bitwise one). It was retained so as to keep backward compatibility with existing installations. [ 16 ] Moreover, in C (and later versions of C) equality operations, with the exception of the three-way comparison operator, yield bool type values which are conceptually a single bit (1 or 0) and as such do not properly belong in ""bitwise"" operations. Notes [ edit ]  The modulus operator only supports integer operands; for floating point, a function such as fmod can be used.  a b c d The int is a dummy parameter to differentiate between prefix and postfix.  About C20 three-way comparison  Possible return types: std::weak_ordering , std::strong_ordering and std::partial_ordering to which they all are convertible to.  a b In the context of iostreams in C, writers often will refer to  and  as the ""put-to"" or ""stream insertion"" and ""get-from"" or ""stream extraction"" operators, respectively.  According to the C99 standard, the right shift of a negative number is implementation defined. Most implementations, e.g., the GCC, [ 3 ] use an arithmetic shift (i.e., sign extension), but a logical shift is possible.  According to the C99 standard, the right shift of a negative number is implementation defined. Most implementations, e.g., the GCC, [ 3 ] use an arithmetic shift (i.e., sign extension), but a logical shift is possible.  a b c since C23  The actual address of an object with an overloaded operator  can be obtained with std::addressof  The return type of operator - () must be a type for which the - operation can be applied, such as a pointer type. If x is of type C where C overloads operator - () , x - y gets expanded to x . operator - () - y .  Meyers, Scott (October 1999), ""Implementing operator- for Smart Pointers"" (PDF) , Dr. Dobb's Journal , Aristeia .  Although a :: punctuator exists in C as of C23, it is not used as a scope resolution operator.  About C11 User-defined literals  a b c d e f g since C11  The parentheses are not necessary when taking the size of a value, only when taking the size of a type. However, they are usually used regardless. [ citation needed ]  C defines alignof operator, whereas C defines _Alignof (C23 defines both). Both operators have the same semantics.  Behaves like const_cast/static_cast/reinterpret_cast. In the last two cases, the auto specifier is replaced with the type of the invented variable x declared with auto x(a); (which is never interpreted as a function declaration) or auto xa; , respectively.  For user-defined conversions, the return type implicitly and necessarily matches the operator name unless the type is inferred (e.g. operator auto () , operator decltype ( auto )() etc.).  The type name can also be inferred (e.g new auto ) if an initializer is provided.  The array size can also be inferred if an initializer is provided.

The most common subjects include Jesus , Mary , saints , and angels . Although especially associated with portrait-style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most of the religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity , including narrative scenes, usually from the Bible or the lives of saints. Icons are most commonly painted on wood panels with egg tempera , but they may also be cast in metal or carved in stone or embroidered on cloth or done in mosaic or fresco work or printed on paper or metal, etc. Comparable images from Western Christianity may be classified as ""icons"", although ""iconic"" may also be used to describe the static style of a devotional image. In the Greek language, the term for icon painting uses the same word as for ""writing"", and Orthodox sources often translate it into English as icon writing . [ 1 ] Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that the production of Christian images dates back to the very early days of Christianity , and that it has been a continuous tradition since then. Modern academic art history considers that, while images may have existed earlier, the tradition can be traced back only as far as the 3rd century, and that the images which survive from Early Christian art often differ greatly from later ones. The icons of later centuries can be linked, often closely, to images from the 5th century onwards, though very few of these survive. Widespread destruction of images occurred during the Byzantine Iconoclasm of 726842, although this did settle permanently the question of the appropriateness of images. Since then, icons have had a great continuity of style and subject, far greater than in the icons of the Western church . At the same time there have been change and development. History [ edit ] Emergence of the icon [ edit ] Further information: Image of Edessa Further information: Religious images in Christian theology Russian icon of the Holy Trinity The icon of St Nicolas carved in stone (between c. 12 and 15th centuries), at the Radomysl Castle , in Ukraine [ 2 ] Luke painting the Theotokos of Vladimir (16th century, Pskov ) A rare ceramic icon depicting Saint Arethas (Byzantine, 10th century) Image of the Saviour Not Made by Hand : a traditional Orthodox iconography in the interpretation of Simon Ushakov (1658). Origins in primitive Christianity in the first century [ edit ] Pre-Christian religions had produced and used art works. [ 3 ] Statues and paintings of various gods and deities were regularly worshiped and venerated. It is unclear when Christians took up such activities. Christian tradition dating from the 8th century identifies Luke the Evangelist as the first icon painter, but this might not reflect historical facts. [ 4 ] A general assumption that early Christianity was generally aniconic , opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney's analysis of early Christian writing and material remains (1994). His assumption distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early Christians on the issue: ""first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen"". [ 5 ] These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that ""overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined"", so placing less emphasis on the Jewish background of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts. [ 5 ] Finney suggests that ""the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti-materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art"". [ 6 ] Aside from the legend that Pilate had made an image of Christ, the 4th-century Eusebius of Caesarea , in his Church History , provides a more substantial reference to a ""first"" icon of Jesus. He relates that King Abgar of Edessa (died c. 50 CE ) sent a letter to Jesus at Jerusalem, asking Jesus to come and heal him of an illness. This version of the Abgar story does not mention an image. A later account found in the Syriac Doctrine of Addai ( c. 400? ) mentions a painted image of Jesus in the story. Even later, in the 6th-century account given by Evagrius Scholasticus , the painted image transforms into an image that miraculously appeared on a towel when Christ pressed the cloth to his wet face. [ 7 ] Further legends relate that the cloth remained in Edessa until the 10th century, when it was taken by General John Kourkouas to Constantinople . It went missing in 1204 when Crusaders sacked Constantinople, but by then numerous copies had firmly established its iconic type. The 4th-century Christian Aelius Lampridius produced the earliest known written records of Christian images treated like icons (in a pagan or Gnostic context) in his Life of Alexander Severus (xxix) that formed part of the Augustan History . According to Lampridius, the emperor Alexander Severus ( r. 222235 ), himself not a Christian, had kept a domestic chapel for the veneration of images of deified emperors, of portraits of his ancestors, and of Christ, Apollonius , Orpheus and Abraham . Saint Irenaeus , ( c. 130202 ) in his Against Heresies (1:25;6) says scornfully of the Gnostic Carpocratians : They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles [pagans]. On the other hand, Irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general senseonly of certain gnostic sectarians' use of icons. Another criticism of image veneration appears in the non-canonical 2nd-century Acts of John (generally considered a gnostic work), in which the Apostle John discovers that one of his followers has had a portrait made of him, and is venerating it: [John] went into the bedchamber, and saw the portrait of an old man crowned with garlands, and lamps and altars set before it. And he called him and said: Lycomedes, what do you mean by this matter of the portrait? Can it be one of thy gods that is painted here? For I see that you are still living in heathen fashion.  Acts of John , 27 Later in the passage John says, ""But this that you have now done is childish and imperfect: you have drawn a dead likeness of the dead."" At least some of the hierarchy of the Christian churches still strictly opposed icons in the early 4th century. At the Spanish non-ecumenical Synod of Elvira ( c. 305 ) bishops concluded, ""Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration"". [ 8 ] Bishop Epiphanius of Salamis , wrote his letter 51 to John, Bishop of Jerusalem ( c. 394 ) in which he recounted how he tore down an image in a church and admonished the other bishop that such images are ""opposed [...] to our religion"". [ 9 ] Icons in Eusebius to Philostorgius (425 AD) [ edit ] Elsewhere in his Church History , Eusebius reports seeing what he took to be portraits of Jesus, Peter and Paul , and also mentions a bronze statue at Banias /Paneas under Mount Hermon, of which he wrote, ""They say that this statue is an image of Jesus"". [ 10 ] Further, he relates that locals regarded the image as a memorial of the healing of the woman with an issue of blood by Jesus (Luke 8:4348), because it depicted a standing man wearing a double cloak and with arm outstretched, and a woman kneeling before him with arms reaching out as if in supplication. John Francis Wilson [ 11 ] suggests the possibility that this refers to a pagan bronze statue whose true identity had been forgotten. Some [ who? ] have thought it to represent Aesculapius , the Greek god of healing, but the description of the standing figure and the woman kneeling in supplication precisely matches images found on coins depicting the bearded emperor Hadrian ( r. 117138 ) reaching out to a female figuresymbolizing a province kneeling before him. When asked by Constantia (Emperor Constantine 's half-sister) for an image of Jesus, Eusebius denied the request, replying: ""To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error."" [ 12 ] Hence Jaroslav Pelikan calls Eusebius ""the father of iconoclasm"". [ 13 ] After the emperor Constantine I extended official toleration of Christianity within the Roman Empire in 313, huge numbers of pagans became converts. This period of the Historiography of Christianization of the Roman Empire probably saw the use of Christian images become very widespread among the faithful, though with great differences from pagan habits. Robin Lane Fox states [ 14 ] ""By the early fifth century, we know of the ownership of private icons of saints; by c. 480500 , we can be sure that the inside of a saint's shrine would be adorned with images and votive portraits, a practice which had probably begun earlier."" When Constantine himself ( r. 306337 ) apparently converted to Christianity, the majority of his subjects remained pagans. The Roman Imperial cult of the divinity of the emperor, expressed through the traditional burning of candles and the offering of incense to the emperor's image, was tolerated for a period because it would have been politically dangerous to attempt to suppress it. [ citation needed ] In the 5th century the courts of justice and municipal buildings of the empire still honoured the portrait of the reigning emperor in this way. [ 15 ] In 425 Philostorgius , an allegedly Arian Christian, charged the Orthodox Christians in Constantinople with idolatry because they still honored the image of the emperor Constantine the Great in this way. Dix notes that this occurred more than a century before the first extant reference to a similar honouring of the image of Jesus or of his apostles or saints known today, but that it would seem a natural progression for the image of Christ, the King of Heaven and Earth, to be paid similar veneration as that given to the earthly Roman emperor. [ 15 ] However, the Orthodox, Eastern Catholics, and other groups insist on explicitly distinguishing the veneration of icons from the worship of idols by pagans. [ 16 ] (See further below on the doctrine of veneration as opposed to worship.) Theodosius to Justinian [ edit ] Christ and Saint Menas , 6th-century Coptic icon from Egypt ( Muse du Louvre ) After adoption of Christianity as the only permissible Roman state religion under Theodosius I , Christian art began to change not only in quality and sophistication, but also in nature. This was in no small part due to Christians being free for the first time to express their faith openly without persecution from the state, in addition to the faith spreading to the non-poor segments of society. Paintings of martyrs and their feats began to appear, and early writers commented on their lifelike effect, one of the elements a few Christian writers criticized in pagan artthe ability to imitate life. The writers mostly criticized pagan works of art for pointing to false gods, thus encouraging idolatry. Statues in the round were avoided as being too close to the principal artistic focus of pagan cult practices, as they have continued to be (with some small-scale exceptions) throughout the history of Eastern Christianity . Nilus of Sinai ( d. c. 430 ), in his Letter to Heliodorus Silentiarius , records a miracle in which Saint Plato of Ankyra appeared to a Christian in a dream. The saint was recognized because the young man had often seen his portrait. This recognition of a religious apparition from likeness to an image was also a characteristic of pagan pious accounts of appearances of gods to humans, and was a regular topos in hagiography. One critical recipient of a vision from Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki apparently specified that the saint resembled the ""more ancient"" images of himpresumably the 7th-century mosaics still in Hagios Demetrios . Another, an African bishop, had been rescued from Arab slavery by a young soldier called Demetrios, who told him to go to his house in Thessaloniki. Having discovered that most young soldiers in the city seemed to be called Demetrios, he gave up and went to the largest church in the city, to find his rescuer on the wall. [ 17 ] The oldest surviving icon of Christ Pantocrator , encaustic on panel , c. 6th century ( Saint Catherine's Monastery , Mount Sinai ) During this period the church began to discourage all non-religious human imagesthe Emperor and donor figures counting as religious. This became largely effective, so that most of the population would only ever see religious images and those of the ruling class. The word icon referred to any and all images, not just religious ones, but there was barely a need for a separate word for these. Luke's portrait of Mary [ edit ] It is in a context attributed to the 5th century that the first mention of an image of Mary painted from life appears, though earlier paintings on catacomb walls bear resemblance to modern icons of Mary. Theodorus Lector , in his 6th-century History of the Church 1:1 [ 18 ] stated that Eudokia (wife of emperor Theodosius II , d. 460) sent an image of the "" Mother of God "" named Icon of the Hodegetria from Jerusalem to Pulcheria , daughter of Arcadius , the former emperor and father of Theodosius II. The image was specified to have been ""painted by the Apostle Luke ."" Margherita Guarducci relates a tradition that the original icon of Mary attributed to Luke, sent by Eudokia to Pulcheria from Palestine, was a large circular icon only of her head. When the icon arrived in Constantinople it was fitted in as the head into a very large rectangular icon of her holding the Christ child and it is this composite icon that became the one historically known as the Hodegetria. She further states another tradition that when the last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II , fled Constantinople in 1261 he took this original circular portion of the icon with him. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] This remained in the possession of the Angevin dynasty who had it inserted into a much larger image of Mary and the Christ child, which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the Benedictine Abbey church of Montevergine . [ 21 ] [ 20 ] This icon was subjected to repeated repainting over the subsequent centuries, so that it is difficult to determine what the original image of Mary's face would have looked like. Guarducci states that in 1950 an ancient image of Mary [ 22 ] at the Church of Santa Francesca Romana was determined to be a very exact, but reverse mirror image of the original circular icon that was made in the 5th century and brought to Rome, where it has remained until the present. [ 23 ] The "" Theotokos of Vladimir "" icon (12th century) symbol of Russia In later tradition the number of icons of Mary attributed to Luke greatly multiplied. [ 24 ] The Salus Populi Romani , the Theotokos of Vladimir , the Theotokos Iverskaya of Mount Athos , the Theotokos of Tikhvin , the Theotokos of Smolensk and the Black Madonna of Czstochowa are examples, and another is in the cathedral on St Thomas Mount , which is believed to be one of the seven painted by Luke the Evangelist and brought to India by Thomas the Apostle . [ 25 ] Ethiopia has at least seven more. [ 26 ] Bissera V. Pentcheva concludes, ""The myth [of Luke painting an icon] was invented in order to support the legitimacy of icon veneration during the Iconoclastic controversy "" (8th and 9th centuries, much later than most art historians put it). According to Reformed Baptist pastor John Carpenter, by claiming the existence of a portrait of the Theotokos painted during her lifetime by the evangelist Luke, the iconodules ""fabricated evidence for the apostolic origins and divine approval of images."" [ 13 ] In the period before and during the Iconoclastic Controversy , stories attributing the creation of icons to the New Testament period greatly increased, with several apostles and even Mary herself believed to have acted as the artist or commissioner of images (also embroidered in the case of Mary). Iconoclast period [ edit ] Main article: Byzantine Iconoclasm 12th-century icon of Archangel Gabriel from Novgorod , called The Angel with Golden Hair , currently exhibited in the State Russian Museum There was a continuing opposition to images and their misuse within Christianity from very early times. ""Whenever images threatened to gain undue influence within the church, theologians have sought to strip them of their power"". [ 27 ] Further, ""there is no century between the fourth and the eighth in which there is not some evidence of opposition to images even within the Church"". [ 28 ] Nonetheless, popular favor for icons guaranteed their continued existence, while no systematic apologia for or against icons, or doctrinal authorization or condemnation of icons yet existed. The use of icons was seriously challenged by Byzantine Imperial authority in the 8th century. Though by this time opposition to images was strongly entrenched in Judaism and Islam, attribution of the impetus toward an iconoclastic movement in Eastern Orthodoxy to Muslims or Jews ""seems to have been highly exaggerated, both by contemporaries and by modern scholars"". [ 29 ] Though significant in the history of religious doctrine, the Byzantine controversy over images is not seen as of primary importance in Byzantine history; ""[f]ew historians still hold it to have been the greatest issue of the period"". [ 30 ] The Iconoclastic period began when images were banned by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian sometime between 726 and 730. Under his son Constantine V , a council forbidding image veneration was held at Hieria near Constantinople in 754. Image veneration was later reinstated by the Empress Regent Irene , under whom another council was held reversing the decisions of the previous iconoclast council and taking its title as Seventh Ecumenical Council . The council anathemized all who hold to iconoclasm, i.e. those who held that veneration of images constitutes idolatry. Then the ban was enforced again by Leo V in 815. Finally, icon veneration was decisively restored by Empress Regent Theodora in 843 at the Council of Constantinople . From then on all Byzantine coins had a religious image or symbol on the reverse , usually an image of Christ for larger denominations, with the head of the Emperor on the obverse, reinforcing the bond of the state and the divine order. [ 17 ] Acheiropoieta [ edit ] Main article: Acheiropoieta The tradition of acheiropoieta (  , literally 'not-made-by-hand') accrued to icons that are alleged to have come into existence miraculously, not by a human painter. Such images functioned as powerful relics as well as icons, and their images were naturally seen as authoritative as to the true appearance of the subject: naturally and especially because of the reluctance to accept mere human productions as embodying anything of the divine, a commonplace of Christian deprecation of man-made "" idols "". Like icons believed to be painted directly from the live subject, they therefore acted as important references for other images in the tradition. Beside the developed legend of the mandylion or Image of Edessa was the tale of the Veil of Veronica , whose very name signifies ""true icon"" or ""true image"", the fear of a ""false image"" remaining strong. Stylistic developments [ edit ] St Peter encaustic on panel , c. 6th century ( Saint Catherine's Monastery ) Although there are earlier records of their use, no panel icons earlier than the few from the 6th century preserved at the Greek Orthodox Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt survive, [ 31 ] as the other examples in Rome have all been drastically over-painted. The surviving evidence for the earliest depictions of Christ, Mary and saints therefore comes from wall-paintings, mosaics and some carvings. [ 32 ] They are realistic in appearance, in contrast to the later stylization. They are broadly similar in style, though often much superior in quality, to the mummy portraits done in wax ( encaustic ) and found at Fayyum in Egypt. As can be judged from such items, the first depictions of Jesus were generic, rather than portrait images, generally representing him as a beardless young man. It was some time before the earliest examples of the long-haired, bearded face that was later to become standardized as the image of Jesus appeared. When they did begin to appear there was still variation. Augustine of Hippo (354430) [ 33 ] said that no one knew the appearance of Jesus or that of Mary. However, Augustine was not a resident of the Holy Land and therefore was not familiar with the local populations and their oral traditions. Gradually, paintings of Jesus took on characteristics of portrait images. At this time the manner of depicting Jesus was not yet uniform, and there was some controversy over which of the two most common icons was to be favored. The first or ""Semitic"" form showed Jesus with short and ""frizzy"" hair; the second showed a bearded Jesus with hair parted in the middle, the manner in which the god Zeus was depicted. Theodorus Lector remarked [ 34 ] that of the two, the one with short and frizzy hair was ""more authentic"". To support his assertion, he relates a story (excerpted by John of Damascus) that a pagan commissioned to paint an image of Jesus used the ""Zeus"" form instead of the ""Semitic"" form, and that as punishment his hands withered. Though their development was gradual, it is possible to date the full-blown appearance and general ecclesiastical (as opposed to simply popular or local) acceptance of Christian images as venerated and miracle-working objects to the 6th century, when, as Hans Belting writes, [ 35 ] ""we first hear of the church's use of religious images"". ""As we reach the second half of the sixth century, we find that images are attracting direct veneration and some of them are credited with the performance of miracles"". [ 36 ] Cyril Mango writes, [ 37 ] ""In the post-Justinianic period the icon assumes an ever increasing role in popular devotion, and there is a proliferation of miracle stories connected with icons, some of them rather shocking to our eyes"". However, the earlier references by Eusebius and Irenaeus indicate veneration of images and reported miracles associated with them as early as the 2nd century. Symbolism [ edit ] In the icons of Eastern Orthodoxy, and of the early Medieval West, very little room is made for artistic license. Almost everything within the image has a symbolic aspect. Christ, the saints, and the angels all have halos. Angels (and often John the Baptist ) have wings because they are messengers. Figures have consistent facial appearances, hold attributes personal to them, and use a few conventional poses.  Archangels bear a thin staff and sometimes a mirror. Colour plays an important role as well. Gold represents the radiance of Heaven; red, divine life. Blue is the colour of human life, white is the Uncreated Light of God, only used for resurrection and transfiguration of Christ. In icons of Jesus and Mary, Jesus wears red undergarment with a blue outer garment (representing God becoming human) and Mary wears a blue undergarment with a red overgarment (representing a human who was granted gifts by God), and thus the doctrine of deification is conveyed by icons. Letters are symbols too. Most icons incorporate some calligraphic text naming the person or event depicted. Even this is often presented in a stylized manner. Palladium and miracles [ edit ] Main articles: Palladium (protective image) , Palladium (classical antiquity) , and Acheiropoieta This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( October 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Our Lady of St. Theodore , a 1703 copy of the 11th-century icon, following the same Byzantine ""Tender Mercy"" type as the Vladimirskaya above The historical tradition of icons used for purposes other than visual depiction are the Palladium (protective image) , the Palladium (classical antiquity) , the acheiropoieta , and various ""folk"" traditions associated with folk religion . Of these various forms the oldest tradition dates back to before the Christian era among the ancient Greeks. The various ""folk"" traditions are more poorly documented and often are associated with local folk narratives of uncertain origin. In English, since around 1600, the word palladium has been used figuratively to mean anything believed to provide protection or safety, [ 38 ] and in particular in Christian contexts a sacred relic or icon believed to have a protective role in military contexts for a whole city, people or nation. Such beliefs first become prominent in the Eastern Churches in the period after the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I , and later spread to the Western church. Palladia were processed around the walls of besieged cities and sometimes carried into battle. [ 39 ] Eastern Orthodox teaching [ edit ] The Eastern Orthodox view of the origin of icons is generally quite different from that of most secular scholars and from some in contemporary Roman Catholic circles:  ""The Orthodox Church maintains and teaches that the sacred image has existed from the beginning of Christianity"", Lonid Ouspensky has written. [ 40 ] Accounts that some non-Orthodox writers consider legendary are accepted as history within Eastern Orthodoxy, because they are a part of church tradition. Thus accounts such as that of the miraculous ""image not made by hands"", and the weeping and moving ""Mother of God of the Sign"" of Novgorod are accepted as fact: ""Church Tradition tells us, for example, of the existence of an Icon of the Savior during His lifetime (the 'Icon-Made-Without-Hands') and of Icons of the Most-Holy Theotokos [Mary] immediately after Him."" [ 41 ] Eastern Orthodoxy further teaches that ""a clear understanding of the importance of Icons"" was part of the church from its very beginning, and has never changed, although explanations of their importance may have developed over time. This is because icon painting is rooted in the theology of the Incarnation (Christ being the eikon of God) which did not change, though its subsequent clarification within the Church occurred over the period of the first seven Ecumenical Councils. Icons also served as tools of edification for the illiterate faithful during most of the history of Christendom . Thus, icons are words in painting; they refer to the history of salvation and to its manifestation in concrete persons. In the Orthodox Church, ""icons have always been understood as a visible gospel, as a testimony to the great things given man by God the incarnate Logos"". [ 42 ] In the Council of 860 it was stated that ""all that is uttered in words written in syllables is also proclaimed in the language of colors"". [ 43 ] Eastern Orthodox find the first instance of an image or icon in the Bible when God made man in his own image (Septuagint Greek eikona ), in Genesis 1:2627. [ 44 ] In Exodus, God commanded that the Israelites not make any graven image; soon afterwards, however, he commanded that they make graven images of cherubim and other like things, both as statues and woven on tapestries. Later, Solomon included still more such imagery when he built the first temple. [ citation needed ] Eastern Orthodox believe these qualify as icons, in that they were visible images depicting heavenly beings and, in the case of the cherubim, used to indirectly indicate God's presence above the Ark. [ citation needed ] In the Book of Numbers [ 45 ] it is written that God told Moses to make a bronze serpent, Nehushtan , and hold it up, so that anyone looking at the snake would be healed of their snake bites. In John 3, Jesus refers to the same serpent, saying that he must be lifted up in the same way that the serpent was. John of Damascus also regarded the brazen serpent as an icon. Further, Jesus Christ himself is called the ""image of the invisible God"" in Colossians 1:15, [ 46 ] and is therefore in one sense an icon. As people are also made in God's images, people are also considered to be living icons, and are therefore "" censed "" along with painted icons during Orthodox prayer services. According to John of Damascus, anyone who tries to destroy icons ""is the enemy of Christ, the Holy Mother of God and the saints, and is the defender of the Devil and his demons"". This is because the theology behind icons is closely tied to the Incarnational theology of the humanity and divinity of Jesus, so that attacks on icons typically have the effect of undermining or attacking the Incarnation of Jesus himself as elucidated in the Ecumenical Councils. Basil of Caesarea , in his writing On the Holy Spirit , says: ""The honor paid to the image passes to the prototype"". He also illustrates the concept by saying, ""If I point to a statue of Caesar and ask you 'Who is that?', your answer would properly be, 'It is Caesar.' When you say such you do not mean that the stone itself is Caesar, but rather, the name and honor you ascribe to the statue passes over to the original, the archetype, Caesar himself."" [ 47 ] This is thus the approach to icons; to kiss an icon of Jesus, in the Eastern Orthodox view, is to show love towards Jesus himself, not mere wood and paint making up the physical substance of the icon. Worship of the icon as somehow entirely separate from its prototype is expressly forbidden by the Seventh Ecumenical Council. [ 42 ] Icons are often illuminated with a candle or jar of oil with a wick. (Beeswax for candles and olive oil for oil lamps are preferred because they burn very cleanly, although other materials are sometimes used.) The illumination of religious images with lamps or candles is an ancient practice pre-dating Christianity. According to Fr. Les Bundy, ""The Ecumenical Counciliar dogmatic decrees on icons refer, in fact, to all religious images including three-dimensional statues. Professor Sergios Verkhovskoi, the conservative professor of dogmatics at St. Vladimirs Seminary forthrightly condemns as heretical anyone who declares statues as unorthodox or in any way canonically inferior to paintings."" [ 48 ] Historically, the Orthodox Church has always approved of veneration of statues, for example, the statue of the Mother of God at Sokolica Monastery in Serbia, [ 49 ] the devotional statues of St. Nil Stolbensky, [ 50 ] and those of St. Paraskeva. [ 51 ] A fairly elaborate Eastern Orthodox icon corner as would be found in a private home A precious Russian icon of Joy of All Who Sorrow , 1862 A somewhat disinterested treatment of the emotional subject and painstaking attention to the throne and other details of the material world distinguish this Italo-Byzantine work by a medieval Sicilian master from works by imperial icon-painters of Constantinople . Icon painting tradition by region [ edit ] Byzantine Empire [ edit ] See also: Byzantine art A key piece of Palaiologan-era mannerism the Annunciation icon from Ohrid in North Macedonia Of the icon painting tradition that developed in Byzantium, with Constantinople as the chief city, we have only a few icons from the 11th century and none preceding them, in part because of the Iconoclastic reforms during which many were destroyed or lost, and also because of plundering by the Republic of Venice in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade , and finally the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. It was only in the Komnenian period (10811185) that the cult of the icon became widespread in the Byzantine world, partly on account of the dearth of richer materials (such as mosaics, ivory , and vitreous enamels ), but also because an iconostasis a special screen for icons was introduced then in ecclesiastical practice. The style of the time was severe, hieratic and distant. In the late Comnenian period this severity softened, and emotion, formerly avoided, entered icon painting. Major monuments for this change include the murals at Daphni Monastery ( c. 1100 ) and the Church of St. Panteleimon near Skopje (1164). The Theotokos of Vladimir ( c. 1115 ) is probably the most representative example of the new trend towards spirituality and emotion. The tendency toward emotionalism in icons continued in the Paleologan period , which began in 1261. Palaiologan art reached its pinnacle in mosaics such as those of Chora Church . In the last half of the 14th century, Palaiologan saints were painted in an exaggerated manner, very slim and in contorted positions  a style known as the Palaiologan Mannerism, of which Ochrid's Annunciation is a superb example. After 1453, the Byzantine tradition was carried on in regions previously influenced by its religion and culturein the Balkans, Russia, and other Slavic countries, Georgia and Armenia in the Caucasus, and among Eastern Orthodox minorities in the Islamic world. In the Greek-speaking world Crete , ruled by Venice until the mid-17th century, was an important centre of painted icons, as home of the Cretan School , exporting many to Europe. Crete [ edit ] Main article: Cretan school Crete was under Venetian control from 1204 and became a thriving center of art with eventually a Scuola di San Luca , or organized painter's guild, the Guild of Saint Luke , on Western lines. Cretan painting was heavily patronized both by Catholics of Venetian territories and by Eastern Orthodox. For ease of transport, Cretan painters specialized in panel paintings, and developed the ability to work in many styles to fit the taste of various patrons. El Greco , who moved to Venice after establishing his reputation in Crete, is the most famous artist of the school, who continued to use many Byzantine conventions in his works. In 1669 the city of Heraklion, on Crete, which at one time boasted at least 120 painters, fell to the Turks. From that time Greek icon painting went into a decline, with a revival attempted in the 20th century by art reformers such as Photis Kontoglou , who emphasized a return to earlier styles. Russia [ edit ] Main articles: Russian icons and List of oldest Russian icons See also: Novgorod school , Moscow school , and Stroganov school Russian icons are typically paintings on wood, often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be as large as a table top. Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the krasny ugol the ""red"" corner (see Icon corner ). There is a rich history and elaborate religious symbolism associated with icons. In Russian churches, the nave is typically separated from the sanctuary by an iconostasis , a wall of icons. The use and making of icons entered Kievan Rus' following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russiansnotably Andrei Rublev and Dionisius widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the 17th century, when Simon Ushakov 's painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe. In the mid-17th century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church . The traditionalists, the persecuted ""Old Ritualists"" or "" Old Believers "", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The Stroganov school and the icons from Nevyansk rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting. Muscovite Mannerism: Harrowing of Hell , by Dionisius and his workshop. Christ the Redeemer (1410s, by Andrei Rublev ) Romania [ edit ] Main article: Romanian Orthodox icons In Romania , icons painted as reversed images behind glass and set in frames were common in the 19th century and are still made. The process is known as reverse glass painting . ""In the Transylvanian countryside, the expensive icons on panels imported from Moldavia, Wallachia, and Mt. Athos were gradually replaced by small, locally produced icons on glass, which were much less expensive and thus accessible to the Transylvanian peasants"". [ 52 ] Serbia [ edit ] Trojeruica meaning ""Three-handed Theotokos"", the most important Serb icon The earliest historical records about icons in Serbia dates back to the period of Nemanji dynasty . One of the notable schools of Serb icons was active in the Bay of Kotor from the 17th century to the 19th century. [ 53 ] Trojeruica meaning ""Three-handed Theotokos"" is the most important icon of the Serbian Orthodox Church and main icon of Mount Athos . Egypt and Ethiopia [ edit ] Main article: Coptic art Ethiopian Orthodox painting of the Virgin Mary nursing the infant Christ The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Oriental Orthodoxy also have distinctive, living icon painting traditions. Coptic icons have their origin in the Hellenistic art of Egyptian Late Antiquity, as exemplified by the Fayum mummy portraits . Beginning in the 4th century, churches painted their walls and made icons to reflect an authentic expression of their faith. Aleppo [ edit ] Main article: Aleppo school The Last Judgement by Nehmatallah Hovsep (1703), one of the most famous icons of the Aleppo School [ 54 ] The Aleppo School was a school of icon-painting, founded by the priest Yusuf al-Musawwir (also known as Joseph the Painter) and active in Aleppo , which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire , between at least 1645 [ 55 ] and 1777. [ 56 ] Western Christianity [ edit ] Although the word ""icon"" is not generally used in Western Christianity , there are religious works of art which were largely patterned on Byzantine works, and equally conventional in composition and depiction. Until the 13th century, icon-like depictions of sacred figures followed Eastern patternsalthough very few survive from this early period. Italian examples are in a style known as Italo-Byzantine . From the 13th century, the Western tradition came slowly to allow the artist far more flexibility, and a more realist approach to the figures. If only because there was a much smaller number of skilled artists, the quantity of works of art, in the sense of panel paintings, was much smaller in the West, and in most Western settings a single diptych as an altarpiece, or in a domestic room, probably stood in place of the larger collections typical of Orthodox "" icon corners "". Only in the 15th century did production of painted works of art begin to approach Eastern levels, supplemented by mass-produced imports from the Cretan School . In this century, the use of icon-like portraits in the West was enormously increased by the introduction of old master prints on paper, mostly woodcuts which were produced in vast numbers (although hardly any survive). They were mostly sold, hand-coloured, by churches, and the smallest sizes (often only an inch high) were affordable even by peasants , who glued or pinned them straight onto a wall. With the Reformation , after an initial uncertainty among early Lutherans, who painted a few icon-like depictions of leading Reformers, and continued to paint scenes from Scripture, Protestants came down firmly against icon-like portraits, especially larger ones, even of Christ. Many Protestants found these idolatrous.

This depiction differs radically from traditional Orthodox iconography. Gilbert House , Stanley, Falkland Islands . Catholic Church view [ edit ] The Catholic Church accepted the decrees of the iconodule Seventh Ecumenical Council regarding images. There is some minor difference, however, in the Catholic attitude to images from that of the Orthodox. Following Gregory the Great , Catholics emphasize the role of images as the Biblia Pauperum , the ""Bible of the Poor"", from which those who could not read could nonetheless learn. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Catholics also, however, share the same viewpoint with the Orthodox when it comes to image veneration, believing that whenever approached, sacred images are to be shown reverence. Though using both flat wooden panel and stretched canvas paintings, Catholics traditionally have also favored images in the form of three-dimensional statuary, whereas in the East, statuary is much less widely employed. Lutheran view [ edit ] A joint LutheranOrthodox statement made in the 7th Plenary of the LutheranOrthodox Joint Commission, in July 1993 in Helsinki, reaffirmed the ecumenical council decisions on the nature of Christ and the veneration of images: 7. As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches. The ecumenical councils maintain the integrity of the teaching of the undivided Church concerning the saving, illuminating/justifying and glorifying acts of God and reject heresies which subvert the saving work of God in Christ. Orthodox and Lutherans, however, have different histories. Lutherans have received the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed with the addition of the filioque . The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known. Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: ""The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects"" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).

Overview of formulas in Excel Applies To Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2024 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Office for business Microsoft Office Get started on how to create formulas and use built-in functions to perform calculations and solve problems. Important: The calculated results of formulas and some Excel worksheet functions may differ slightly between a Windows PC using x86 or x86-64 architecture and a Windows RT PC using ARM architecture. Learn more about the differences . Important: In this article we discuss XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP, which are similar. Try using the new XLOOKUP function, an improved version of VLOOKUP that works in any direction and returns exact matches by default, making it easier and more convenient to use than its predecessor. Create a formula that refers to values in other cells Select a cell. Type the equal sign . Note: Formulas in Excel always begin with the equal sign. Select a cell or type its address in the selected cell. Enter an operator. For example,  for subtraction. Select the next cell, or type its address in the selected cell. Press Enter. The result of the calculation appears in the cell with the formula. See a formula When a formula is entered into a cell, it also appears in the Formula bar. To see a formula in the formula bar, select a cell. Enter a formula that contains a built-in function Select an empty cell. Type an equal sign  and then type a function. For example, SUM for getting the total sales. Type an opening parenthesis (. Select the range of cells, and then type a closing parenthesis). Press Enter to get the result. Download our Formulas tutorial workbook We've put together a Get started with Formulas workbook that you can download. If you're new to Excel, or even if you have some experience with it, you can walk through Excel's most common formulas in this tour. With real-world examples and helpful visuals, you'll be able to Sum, Count, Average, and Vlookup like a pro. Formulas in-depth You can browse through the individual sections below to learn more about specific formula elements. The parts of an Excel formula A formula can also contain any or all of the following: functions , references , operators , and constants . Parts of a formula 1. Functions : The PI() function returns the value of pi: 3.142... 2. References : A2 returns the value in cell A2. 3. Constants : Numbers or text values entered directly into a formula, such as 2. 4. Operators : The  (caret) operator raises a number to a power, and the  (asterisk) operator multiplies numbers. Using constants in Excel formulas A constant is a value that is not calculated; it always stays the same. For example, the date 10/9/2008, the number 210, and the text ""Quarterly Earnings"" are all constants. An                  expression                  or a value resulting from an expression is not a constant. If you use constants in a formula instead of references to cells (for example, 3070110), the result changes only if you modify the formula. In general, it's best to place constants in individual cells where they can be easily changed if needed, then reference those cells in formulas. Using references in Excel formulas A reference identifies a cell or a range of cells on a worksheet, and tells Excel where to look for the values or data you want to use in a formula. You can use references to use data contained in different parts of a worksheet in one formula or use the value from one cell in several formulas. You can also refer to cells on other sheets in the same workbook, and to other workbooks. References to cells in other workbooks are called links or external references. The A1 reference style By default, Excel uses the A1 reference style, which refers to columns with letters (A through XFD, for a total of 16,384 columns) and refers to rows with numbers (1 through 1,048,576). These letters and numbers are called row and column headings. To refer to a cell, enter the column letter followed by the row number. For example, B2 refers to the cell at the intersection of column B and row 2. To refer to Use The cell in column A and row 10 A10 The range of cells in column A and rows 10 through 20 A10:A20 The range of cells in row 15 and columns B through E B15:E15 All cells in row 5 5:5 All cells in rows 5 through 10 5:10 All cells in column H H:H All cells in columns H through J H:J The range of cells in columns A through E and rows 10 through 20 A10:E20 Making a reference to a cell or a range of cells on another worksheet in the same workbook In the following example, the AVERAGE function calculates the average value for the range B1:B10 on the worksheet named Marketing in the same workbook. 1. Refers to the worksheet named Marketing 2. Refers to the range of cells from B1 to B10 3. The exclamation point (!) separates the worksheet reference from the cell range reference Note: If the referenced worksheet has spaces or numbers in it, you need to add apostrophes (') before and after the worksheet name, like '123'!A1 or 'January Revenue'!A1. The difference between absolute, relative and mixed references Relative references A relative cell reference in a formula, such as A1, is based on the relative position of the cell that contains the formula and the cell the reference refers to. If the position of the cell that contains the formula changes, the reference is changed. If you copy or fill the formula across rows or down columns, the reference automatically adjusts. By default, new formulas use relative references. For example, if you copy or fill a relative reference in cell B2 to cell B3, it automatically adjusts from A1 to A2. Copied formula with relative reference Absolute references An absolute cell reference in a formula, such as A1, always refer to a cell in a specific location. If the position of the cell that contains the formula changes, the absolute reference remains the same. If you copy or fill the formula across rows or down columns, the absolute reference does not adjust. By default, new formulas use relative references, so you may need to switch them to absolute references. For example, if you copy or fill an absolute reference in cell B2 to cell B3, it stays the same in both cells: A1. Copied formula with absolute reference Mixed references A mixed reference has either an absolute column and relative row, or absolute row and relative column. An absolute column reference takes the form A1, B1, and so on. An absolute row reference takes the form A1, B1, and so on. If the position of the cell that contains the formula changes, the relative reference is changed, and the absolute reference does not change. If you copy or fill the formula across rows or down columns, the relative reference automatically adjusts, and the absolute reference does not adjust. For example, if you copy or fill a mixed reference from cell A2 to B3, it adjusts from A1 to B1. Copied formula with mixed reference The 3-D reference style Conveniently referencing multiple worksheets If you want to analyze data in the same cell or range of cells on multiple worksheets within a workbook, use a 3-D reference. A 3-D reference includes the cell or range reference, preceded by a range of worksheet names. Excel uses any worksheets stored between the starting and ending names of the reference. For example, SUM(Sheet2:Sheet13!B5) adds all the values contained in cell B5 on all the worksheets between and including Sheet 2 and Sheet 13. You can use 3-D references to refer to cells on other sheets, to define names, and to create formulas by using the following functions: SUM, AVERAGE, AVERAGEA, COUNT, COUNTA, MAX, MAXA, MIN, MINA, PRODUCT, STDEV.P, STDEV.S, STDEVA, STDEVPA, VAR.P, VAR.S, VARA, and VARPA. 3-D references cannot be used in array formulas. 3-D references cannot be used with the intersection                                  operator                                  (a single space) or in formulas that use                                  implicit intersection                                  . What occurs when you move, copy, insert, or delete worksheets The following examples explain what happens when you move, copy, insert, or delete worksheets that are included in a 3-D reference. The examples use the formula SUM(Sheet2:Sheet6!A2:A5) to add cells A2 through A5 on worksheets 2 through 6. Insert or copy If you insert or copy sheets between Sheet2 and Sheet6 (the endpoints in this example), Excel includes all values in cells A2 through A5 from the added sheets in the calculations. Delete If you delete sheets between Sheet2 and Sheet6, Excel removes their values from the calculation. Move If you move sheets from between Sheet2 and Sheet6 to a location outside the referenced sheet range, Excel removes their values from the calculation. Move an endpoint If you move Sheet2 or Sheet6 to another location in the same workbook, Excel adjusts the calculation to accommodate the new range of sheets between them. Delete an endpoint If you delete Sheet2 or Sheet6, Excel adjusts the calculation to accommodate the range of sheets between them. The R1C1 reference style You can also use a reference style where both the rows and the columns on the worksheet are numbered. The R1C1 reference style is useful for computing row and column positions in macros. In the R1C1 style, Excel indicates the location of a cell with an ""R"" followed by a row number and a ""C"" followed by a column number. Reference Meaning R[-2]C A                                          relative reference                                          to the cell two rows up and in the same column R[2]C[2] A relative reference to the cell two rows down and two columns to the right R2C2 An absolute reference to the cell in the second row and in the second column R[-1] A relative reference to the entire row above the active cell R An absolute reference to the current row When you record a macro, Excel records some commands by using the R1C1 reference style. For example, if you record a command, such as selecting the AutoSum button to insert a formula that adds a range of cells, Excel records the formula by using R1C1 style, not A1 style, references. You can turn the R1C1 reference style on or off by setting or clearing the R1C1 reference style check box under the Working with formulas section in the Formulas category of the Options dialog box.

As formulas are entirely constituted with symbols of various types, many symbols are needed for expressing all mathematics. The most basic symbols are the decimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and the letters of the Latin alphabet . The decimal digits are used for representing numbers through the HinduArabic numeral system . Historically, upper-case letters were used for representing points in geometry, and lower-case letters were used for variables and constants . Letters are used for representing many other types of mathematical object . As the number of these types has increased, the Greek alphabet and some Hebrew letters have also come to be used. For more symbols, other typefaces are also used, mainly boldface  a , A , b , B ,  displaystyle mathbf a,A,b,B ,ldots   , script typeface A , B ,  displaystyle mathcal A,B,ldots  (the lower-case script face is rarely used because of the possible confusion with the standard face), German fraktur  a , A , b , B ,  displaystyle mathfrak a,A,b,B,ldots   , and blackboard bold  N , Z , Q , R , C , H , F q displaystyle mathbb N,Z,Q,R,C,H,F _q  (the other letters are rarely used in this face, or their use is unconventional).  It is commonplace to use alphabets, fonts and typefaces to group symbols by type. The use of specific Latin and Greek letters as symbols for denoting mathematical objects is not described in this article. For such uses, see Variable  Conventional variable names and List of mathematical constants . However, some symbols that are described here have the same shape as the letter from which they are derived, such as  displaystyle textstyle prod  and  displaystyle textstyle sum  . These letters alone are not sufficient for the needs of mathematicians, and many other symbols are used. Some take their origin in punctuation marks and diacritics traditionally used in typography ; others by deforming letter forms , as in the cases of  displaystyle in  and  displaystyle forall  . Others, such as  and  , were specially designed for mathematics. Layout of this article [ edit ] Normally, entries of a glossary are structured by topics and sorted alphabetically. This is not possible here, as there is no natural order on symbols, and many symbols are used in different parts of mathematics with different meanings, often completely unrelated. Therefore, some arbitrary choices had to be made, which are summarized below. The article is split into sections that are sorted by an increasing level of technicality. That is, the first sections contain the symbols that are encountered in most mathematical texts, and that are supposed to be known even by beginners. On the other hand, the last sections contain symbols that are specific to some area of mathematics and are ignored outside these areas. However, the long section on brackets has been placed near to the end, although most of its entries are elementary: this makes it easier to search for a symbol entry by scrolling. Most symbols have multiple meanings that are generally distinguished either by the area of mathematics where they are used or by their syntax , that is, by their position inside a formula and the nature of the other parts of the formula that are close to them. As readers may not be aware of the area of mathematics to which the symbol that they are looking for is related, the different meanings of a symbol are grouped in the section corresponding to their most common meaning. When the meaning depends on the syntax, a symbol may have different entries depending on the syntax. For summarizing the syntax in the entry name, the symbol  displaystyle Box  is used for representing the neighboring parts of a formula that contains the symbol. See  Brackets for examples of use. Most symbols have two printed versions. They can be displayed as Unicode characters, or in LaTeX format. With the Unicode version, using search engines and copy-pasting are easier. On the other hand, the LaTeX rendering is often much better (more aesthetic), and is generally considered a standard in mathematics. Therefore, in this article, the Unicode version of the symbols is used (when possible) for labelling their entry, and the LaTeX version is used in their description. So, for finding how to type a symbol in LaTeX, it suffices to look at the source of the article. For most symbols, the entry name is the corresponding Unicode symbol. So, for searching the entry of a symbol, it suffices to type or copy the Unicode symbol into the search textbox. Similarly, when possible, the entry name of a symbol is also an anchor , which allows linking easily from another Wikipedia article. When an entry name contains special characters such as [,], and , there is also an anchor, but one has to look at the article source to know it. Finally, when there is an article on the symbol itself (not its mathematical meaning), it is linked to in the entry name.

Blackboard bold [ edit ] The blackboard bold typeface is widely used for denoting the basic number systems . These systems are often also denoted by the corresponding uppercase bold letter.

D2787291	https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html	9.2. math  Mathematical functions  Python 2.7.18 documentation This document is for an old version of Python that is no longer supported .     You should upgrade and read the Python documentation for the current stable release . Navigation index modules  next  previous  Python  Python 2.7.18 documentation  The Python Standard Library  9. Numeric and Mathematical Modules  9.2. math  Mathematical functions  This module is always available.  It provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for complex numbers.  The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which dont is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers.  Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place. The following functions are provided by this module.  Except when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats. 9.2.1. Number-theoretic and representation functions  math. ceil ( x )  Return the ceiling of x as a float, the smallest integer value greater than or equal to x . math. copysign ( x , y )  Return x with the sign of y .  On a platform that supports signed zeros, copysign(1.0, -0.0) returns -1.0 . New in version 2.6. math. fabs ( x )  Return the absolute value of x . math. factorial ( x )  Return x factorial.  Raises ValueError if x is not integral or is negative. New in version 2.6. math. floor ( x )  Return the floor of x as a float, the largest integer value less than or equal to x . math. fmod ( x , y )  Return fmod(x, y) , as defined by the platform C library. Note that the Python expression x  y may not return the same result.  The intent of the C standard is that fmod(x, y) be exactly (mathematically; to infinite precision) equal to x - ny for some integer n such that the result has the same sign as x and magnitude less than abs(y) .  Pythons x  y returns a result with the sign of y instead, and may not be exactly computable for float arguments. For example, fmod(-1e-100, 1e100) is -1e-100 , but the result of Pythons -1e-100  1e100 is 1e100-1e-100 , which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising 1e100 .  For this reason, function fmod() is generally preferred when working with floats, while Pythons x  y is preferred when working with integers. math. frexp ( x )  Return the mantissa and exponent of x as the pair (m, e) . m is a float and e is an integer such that x  m  2e exactly. If x is zero, returns (0.0, 0) , otherwise 0.5  abs(m)  1 .  This is used to pick apart the internal representation of a float in a portable way. math. fsum ( iterable )  Return an accurate floating point sum of values in the iterable.  Avoids loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums:  sum ([ . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 ]) 0.9999999999999999  fsum ([ . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 , . 1 ]) 1.0 The algorithms accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the typical case where the rounding mode is half-even.  On some non-Windows builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its least significant bit. For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the ASPN cookbook recipes for accurate floating point summation . New in version 2.6. math. isinf ( x )  Check if the float x is positive or negative infinity. New in version 2.6. math. isnan ( x )  Check if the float x is a NaN (not a number).  For more information on NaNs, see the IEEE 754 standards. New in version 2.6. math. ldexp ( x , i )  Return x  (2i) .  This is essentially the inverse of function frexp() . math. modf ( x )  Return the fractional and integer parts of x .  Both results carry the sign of x and are floats. math. trunc ( x )  Return the Real value x truncated to an Integral (usually a long integer).  Uses the __trunc__ method. New in version 2.6. Note that frexp() and modf() have a different call/return pattern than their C equivalents: they take a single argument and return a pair of values, rather than returning their second return value through an output parameter (there is no such thing in Python). For the ceil() , floor() , and modf() functions, note that all floating-point numbers of sufficiently large magnitude are exact integers. Python floats typically carry no more than 53 bits of precision (the same as the platform C double type), in which case any float x with abs(x)  252 necessarily has no fractional bits. 9.2.2. Power and logarithmic functions  math. exp ( x )  Return ex . math. expm1 ( x )  Return ex - 1 .  For small floats x , the subtraction in exp(x) - 1 can result in a significant loss of precision; the expm1() function provides a way to compute this quantity to full precision:  from math import exp , expm1  exp ( 1e-5 ) - 1  gives result accurate to 11 places 1.0000050000069649e-05  expm1 ( 1e-5 )  result accurate to full precision 1.0000050000166668e-05 New in version 2.7. math. log ( x [ , base ] )  With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e ). With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base , calculated as log(x)/log(base) . Changed in version 2.3: base argument added. math. log1p ( x )  Return the natural logarithm of 1x (base e ). The result is calculated in a way which is accurate for x near zero. New in version 2.6. math. log10 ( x )  Return the base-10 logarithm of x .  This is usually more accurate than log(x, 10) . math. pow ( x , y )  Return x raised to the power y .  Exceptional cases follow Annex F of the C99 standard as far as possible.  In particular, pow(1.0, x) and pow(x, 0.0) always return 1.0 , even when x is a zero or a NaN.  If both x and y are finite, x is negative, and y is not an integer then pow(x, y) is undefined, and raises ValueError . Unlike the built-in  operator, math.pow() converts both its arguments to type float .  Use  or the built-in pow() function for computing exact integer powers. Changed in version 2.6: The outcome of 1nan and nan0 was undefined. math. sqrt ( x )  Return the square root of x . 9.2.3. Trigonometric functions  math. acos ( x )  Return the arc cosine of x , in radians. math. asin ( x )  Return the arc sine of x , in radians. math. atan ( x )  Return the arc tangent of x , in radians. math. atan2 ( y , x )  Return atan(y / x) , in radians. The result is between -pi and pi . The vector in the plane from the origin to point (x, y) makes this angle with the positive X axis. The point of atan2() is that the signs of both inputs are known to it, so it can compute the correct quadrant for the angle. For example, atan(1) and atan2(1, 1) are both pi/4 , but atan2(-1, -1) is -3pi/4 . math. cos ( x )  Return the cosine of x radians. math. hypot ( x , y )  Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(xx  yy) . This is the length of the vector from the origin to point (x, y) . math. sin ( x )  Return the sine of x radians. math. tan ( x )  Return the tangent of x radians. 9.2.4. Angular conversion  math. degrees ( x )  Convert angle x from radians to degrees. math. radians ( x )  Convert angle x from degrees to radians. 9.2.5. Hyperbolic functions  math. acosh ( x )  Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x . New in version 2.6. math. asinh ( x )  Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x . New in version 2.6. math. atanh ( x )  Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x . New in version 2.6. math. cosh ( x )  Return the hyperbolic cosine of x . math. sinh ( x )  Return the hyperbolic sine of x . math. tanh ( x )  Return the hyperbolic tangent of x . 9.2.6. Special functions  math. erf ( x )  Return the error function at x . New in version 2.7. math. erfc ( x )  Return the complementary error function at x . New in version 2.7. math. gamma ( x )  Return the Gamma function at x . New in version 2.7. math. lgamma ( x )  Return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma function at x . New in version 2.7. 9.2.7. Constants  math. pi  The mathematical constant   3.141592, to available precision. math. e  The mathematical constant e  2.718281, to available precision. CPython implementation detail: The math module consists mostly of thin wrappers around the platform C math library functions.  Behavior in exceptional cases follows Annex F of the C99 standard where appropriate.  The current implementation will raise ValueError for invalid operations like sqrt(-1.0) or log(0.0) (where C99 Annex F recommends signaling invalid operation or divide-by-zero), and OverflowError for results that overflow (for example, exp(1000.0) ).  A NaN will not be returned from any of the functions above unless one or more of the input arguments was a NaN; in that case, most functions will return a NaN, but (again following C99 Annex F) there are some exceptions to this rule, for example pow(float('nan'), 0.0) or hypot(float('nan'), float('inf')) . Note that Python makes no effort to distinguish signaling NaNs from quiet NaNs, and behavior for signaling NaNs remains unspecified. Typical behavior is to treat all NaNs as though they were quiet. Changed in version 2.6: Behavior in special cases now aims to follow C99 Annex F.  In earlier versions of Python the behavior in special cases was loosely specified.

Image by Mike DeHaan What is a factorial, and how is it used in mathematics? The Mathematical Definition of Factorial for Positive Integers In mathematics, a factorial is a function applied to natural numbers greater than zero. The symbol for the factorial function is an exclamation mark after a number, like this: 2! The usual definition of n factorial is n!  n  (n  1)  (n  2)  2  1, where n is a positive integer. The first handful of factorial values from positive integers are: 1!  1; 2!  2; 3!  32  6; 4!  432  24; and 5!  5432  120. In the image, only the first five factorial results are plotted although the first ten have been calculated. Recursive Definition for the Factorial A recursive definition for the factorial function is n!  n  (n-1)!, placing the lower limit for the recursion at n2. Factorial Function: Practical Uses Although the factorial function deals with repeated multiplication, its most obvious use in math is to compute the number of ways in which n objects can be permuted . A permutation is a re-arrangement of a set. For example, set Aa has exactly one arrangement. However, set Ba,b could be re-arranged as b,a; and set Ca,b,c has the six permutations (a,b,c), (a,c,b), (b,a,c), (b,c,a), (c,a,b), (c,b,a). Note that A  1 (set A has one element), B  2 and C has three; but they have 1, 2 and 6 permutations respectively. Our readers are invited to list the permutations for set Da,b,c,d, but there should be two dozen in that permutation set. This extends to selecting permutations of an ordered subset . From set Ca,b,c, how many ways can two elements be selected and permuted? The solution set is (a,b), (b,a), (a,c), (c,a), (b,c), (c,b), and has six elements.

Comments Been a while since highschool says June 29, 2018 at 1:00 am So I have never studied factorials, and can someone open up what it actually means? I thought that if: n!  n  (n  1)  (n  2)  2  1 Then 1! would be 1!  1(1-1) and after that nothing else matters, as they are all multiplied with eachother and the result should be zero  so why is 1!  1? Reply Selim says July 2, 2018 at 9:00 am a factorial is a function applied to natural numbers greater than zero. Reply Devrishi says January 28, 2019 at 9:14 pm As factorial is applicable cable to only natural no. And 1 is the first no.therefore, in case of one there is only n.similarly in case of 2, 2! Will be  n(n-1) .but not   n(n-1) (n-2) as n-2 will be not a natural no.

Reply stanley ness says December 16, 2016 at 9:43 am You elitests talk past the layman who wants a simple explanation when used in a formula. Ex.cubic inches of a pipe to calculate volume of water. Reply says March 13, 2017 at 11:41 am Harambea e says August 8, 2016 at 2:09 pm I wrote javascript in the console to play with the concept. to be honest, I think the reason math is so impenetrable for people is that if you took the same way people write math problems out to code, people would hate your guts. Everything is horrible shorthand. I came to this page because I wanted to know how the formula on this page works ( http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/sine_calculator.php ). Theres no explanation of the logic behind these concepts, or why they get you to the right answer. I can appreciate the quick and dirty need to just utilize functions and things people have already figured out, but for the curious mind there is so little nourishment. Why does it work, what do these sub calculations represent, if I wanted to recombined them in different ways to solve new problems, I cant because I dont know what they mean. I can really struggle thinking just factorial out for an hour, to say, well the reason 32 works is that the 2 represents the number of times each element can appear at the beginning of the set, and 432 works because the each element can appear at the beginning of the set 3 times, and when youve accounted for those possibilities, the number of remaining variations for those sets are the number of times each element of the remaining elements are going to appear first, but be damned if anyone is going to try to put that in English, or spend more than the 5 minutes I spent hear trying to make it actually coherent to someone just encountering this concept. And the only reason I can sort of make sense of it is because I spent a lot of time thinking about it one time as a kid, not because any teacher tried to explain or even knew themselves why it worked. ok thats my rant ! At least the page I found above was better than the broken responses you normally find when asking what actually is sin and people just tell you what sin is useful for. var factorial  function(n)  if (n  2)  return n  factorial(n  1)  else  return n   undefined factorial(2) 2 factorial(3) 6 factorial(4) 24 factorial(5) 120 factorial(56) 7.109985878048635e74 Reply Seth says April 28, 2016 at 10:42 am Simplify: 5! 8!2!

Here the .9 has a bar .i.e. 6.999999999999 (Infinite) hence we summed it up to 7 Reply Bill says January 20, 2016 at 6:46 am 6 point (infinite number of 9s) is the same as 7. No need to round up. 5 is wrong as it uses 9! (factorial) to mean 981 rather than multiplied by Reply Mike DeHaan says August 13, 2012 at 4:24 pm Excellent question. By appeal to authority in Wolfram, The special case 0! is defined to have value 0!1, consistent with the combinatorial interpretation of there being exactly one way to arrange zero objects (i.e., there is a single permutation of zero elements, namely the empty set). Wikipedias Gamma function has the line Combining this with (1)  1, we get (n)  (n-1)! when defining the gamma function. Plus SosMath discusses the gamma function as an integral, noting that e(-1)  1 (and should have noted x0  1). Further down the page, they derive (1)  1 from the integral. (See http://sosmath.com/calculus/improper/gamma/gamma.html ). My basic answer is: it works out nicely when relating factorials to the gamma function. (Sorry I hadnt checked my mail over the weekend!) Reply joe franco says August 9, 2012 at 8:31 am why is 0!  1 Reply meshfields_blog says April 21, 2014 at 3:07 am Because the number of possible permutations of 0! is 1. The empty set   is still one empty set with one permutation inside. Proof: Let n1, using the definition n!  n(n-1)! then is 1!  10! which can be simplified to 1  0!.

Taylor, Ph.D., is a professor of mathematics at Anderson University and the author of ""An Introduction to Abstract Algebra."" Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on October 04, 2019 Close In mathematics, symbols that have certain meanings in the English language can mean very specialized and different things. For example, consider the following expression: 3! No, we did not use the exclamation point to show that were excited about three, and we shouldnt read the last sentence with emphasis. In mathematics, the expression 3! is read as ""three factorial"" and is really a shorthand way to denote the multiplication of several consecutive whole numbers. Since there are many places throughout mathematics and statistics where we need to multiply numbers together, the factorial is quite useful. Some of the main places where it shows up are combinatorics and probability calculus . Definition The definition of the factorial is that for any positive whole number n , the factorial: n !  n x (n -1) x (n - 2) x . . . x 2 x 1 Examples for Small Values First we will look at a few examples of the factorial with small values of n : 1!  1 2!  2 x 1  2 3!  3 x 2 x 1  6 4!  4 x 3 x 2 x 1  24 5!  5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1  120 6!  6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1  720 7!  7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1  5040 8!  8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1  40320 9!  9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1  362880 10!  10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1  3628800 As we can see the factorial gets very large very quickly. Something that may seem small, such as 20! actually has 19 digits. Factorials are easy to compute, but they can be somewhat tedious to calculate. Fortunately, many calculators have a factorial key (look for the ! symbol). This function of the calculator will automate the multiplications. A Special Case One other value of the factorial and one for which the standard definition above does not hold is that of zero factorial . If we follow the formula, then we would not arrive at any value for 0!. There are no positive whole numbers less than 0. For several reasons, it is appropriate to define 0!  1. The factorial for this value shows up particularly in the formulas for combinations and permutations . More Advanced Calculations When dealing with calculations, it is important to think before we press the factorial key on our calculator. To calculate an expression such as 100!/98! there are a couple of different ways of going about this. One way is to use a calculator to find both 100! and 98!, then divide one by the other. Although this is a direct way to calculate, it has some difficulties associated with it. Some calculators cannot handle expressions as large as 100!  9.33262154 x 10 157 . (The expression 10 157 is a scientific notation that means that we multiply by 1 followed by 157 zeros.) Not only is this number massive, but it is also only an estimate to the real value of 100! Another way to simplify an expression with factorials like the one seen here does not require a calculator at all. The way to approach this problem is to recognize that we can rewrite 100! not as 100 x 99 x 98 x 97 x . . . x 2 x 1, but instead as 100 x 99 x 98! The expression 100!/98! now becomes (100 x 99 x 98!)/98!  100 x 99  9900. Cite this Article Format mla apa chicago Your Citation Taylor, Courtney.

The Python language has many similarities to Perl , C , and Java . However, there are some definite differences between the languages. It supports multiple programming paradigms , including structured, object-oriented programming , and functional programming , and boasts a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. Python's syntax is simple and consistent, adhering to the principle that ""There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it."" The language incorporates built-in data types and structures, control flow mechanisms, first-class functions , and modules for better code reusability and organization. Python also uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation, contributing to its uncluttered visual layout. The language provides robust error handling through exceptions, and includes a debugger in the standard library for efficient problem-solving. Python's syntax, designed for readability and ease of use, makes it a popular choice among beginners and professionals alike. Design philosophy [ edit ] Python was designed to be a highly readable language. [ 1 ] It has a relatively uncluttered visual layout and uses English keywords frequently where other languages use punctuation . Python aims to be simple and consistent in the design of its syntax, encapsulated in the mantra ""There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it"", from the Zen of Python . [ 2 ] This mantra is deliberately opposed to the Perl and Ruby mantra, "" there's more than one way to do it "". Keywords [ edit ] Python has 35 keywords or reserved words ; they cannot be used as identifiers . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and as assert async [ note 1 ] await [ note 1 ] break class continue def del elif else except False [ note 2 ] finally for from global if import in is lambda None nonlocal [ note 3 ] not or pass raise return True [ note 2 ] try while with yield In addition, Python also has 3 soft keywords . Unlike regular hard keywords , soft keywords are reserved words only in the limited contexts where interpreting them as keywords would make syntactic sense. These words can be used as identifiers elsewhere, in other words, match and case are valid names for functions and variables. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] _ [ note 4 ] case [ note 4 ] match [ note 4 ] Notes  a b async and await were introduced in Python 3.5. [ 5 ]  a b True and False became keywords in Python 3.0. Previously they were global variables .  nonlocal was introduced in Python 3.0.  a b c match , case and _ were introduced as keywords in Python 3.10. Indentation [ edit ] Python uses whitespace to delimit control flow blocks (following the off-side rule ). Python borrows this feature from its predecessor ABC : instead of punctuation or keywords, it uses indentation to indicate the run of a block . In so-called ""free-format"" languagesthat use the block structure derived from ALGOL blocks of code are set off with braces (   ) or keywords. In most coding conventions for these languages, programmers conventionally indent the code within a block, to visually set it apart from the surrounding code. A recursive function named foo , which is passed a single parameter , x , and if the parameter is 0 will call a different function named bar and otherwise will call baz , passing x , and also call itself recursively, passing x-1 as the parameter, could be implemented like this in Python: def foo ( x ): if x  0 : bar () else : baz ( x ) foo ( x - 1 ) and could be written like this in C with KR indent style : void foo ( int x )  if ( x  0 )  bar ();  else  baz ( x ); foo ( x - 1 );   Incorrectly indented code could be misread by a human reader differently than it would be interpreted by a compiler or interpreter. For example, if the function call foo(x - 1) on the last line in the example above was erroneously indented to be outside the if / else block: def foo ( x ): if x  0 : bar () else : baz ( x ) foo ( x - 1 ) it would cause the last line to always be executed, even when x is 0, resulting in an endless recursion . While both space and tab characters are accepted as forms of indentation and any multiple of spaces can be used, spaces are recommended [ 8 ] and 4 spaces (as in the above examples) are recommended and are by far the most commonly used. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ unreliable source? ] Mixing spaces and tabs on consecutive lines is not allowed starting with Python 3 [ 11 ] because that can create bugs which are difficult to see, since many text editors do not visually distinguish spaces and tabs. Data structures [ edit ] See also: Python (programming language)  Typing Since Python is a dynamically-typed language, Python values, not variables, carry type information. All variables in Python hold references to objects , and these references are passed to functions. Some people (including Guido van Rossum himself) have called this parameter-passing scheme ""call by object reference"". An object reference means a name, and the passed reference is an ""alias"", i.e. a copy of the reference to the same object, just as in C/ C . The object's value may be changed in the called function with the ""alias"", for example:  alist  [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ]  def my_func ( al ): ... al . append ( 'x' ) ... print ( al ) ...  my_func ( alist ) ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x']  alist ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'] Function my_func changes the value of alist with the formal argument al , which is an alias of alist . However, any attempt to operate (assign a new object reference to) on the alias itself will have no effect on the original object. [ clarification needed ]  alist  [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ]  def my_func ( al ): ...  al.append('x') ... al  al  [ 'x' ]  a new list created and assigned to al means al is no more alias for alist ... print ( al ) ...  my_func ( alist ) ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x']  print ( alist ) ['a', 'b', 'c'] In Python, non-innermost-local and not-declared-global accessible names are all aliases. Among dynamically-typed languages, Python is moderately type-checked. Implicit conversion is defined for numeric types (as well as booleans ), so one may validly multiply a complex number by an integer (for instance) without explicit casting . However, there is no implicit conversion between, for example, numbers and strings ; a string is an invalid argument to a mathematical function expecting a number. Base types [ edit ] Python has a broad range of basic data types. Alongside conventional integer and floating-point arithmetic, it transparently supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic , complex numbers , and decimal numbers . Python supports a wide variety of string operations. Strings in Python are immutable , so a string operation such as a substitution of characters , that in other programming languages might alter the string in place , returns a new string in Python. Performance considerations sometimes push for using special techniques in programs that modify strings intensively, such as joining character arrays into strings only as needed. Collection types [ edit ] One of the very useful aspects of Python is the concept of collection (or container ) types. In general a collection is an object that contains other objects in a way that is easily referenced or indexed . Collections come in two basic forms: sequences and mappings . The ordered sequential types are lists (dynamic arrays ), tuples , and strings. All sequences are indexed positionally ( 0 through length - 1 ) and all but strings can contain any type of object, including multiple types in the same sequence. Both strings and tuples are immutable, making them perfect candidates for dictionary keys (see below). Lists, on the other hand, are mutable; elements can be inserted, deleted, modified, appended, or sorted in-place . Mappings, on the other hand, are (often unordered) types implemented in the form of dictionaries which ""map"" a set of immutable keys to corresponding elements (much like a mathematical function).  For example, one could define a dictionary having a string ""toast"" mapped to the integer 42 or vice versa. The keys in a dictionary must be of an immutable Python type, such as an integer or a string, because under the hood they are implemented via a hash function . This makes for much faster lookup times, but requires keys not change. Dictionaries are central to the internals of Python as they reside at the core of all objects and classes: the mappings between variable names (strings) and the values which the names reference are stored as dictionaries (see Object system ). Since these dictionaries are directly accessible (via an object's __dict__ attribute), metaprogramming is a straightforward and natural process in Python. A set collection type is an unindexed, unordered collection that contains no duplicates, and implements set theoretic operations such as union , intersection , difference , symmetric difference , and subset testing. There are two types of sets: set and frozenset , the only difference being that set is mutable and frozenset is immutable. Elements in a set must be hashable. Thus, for example, a frozenset can be an element of a regular set whereas the opposite is not true. Python also provides extensive collection manipulating abilities such as built in containment checking and a generic iteration protocol. Object system [ edit ] In Python, everything is an object, even classes. Classes, as objects, have a class, which is known as their metaclass . Python also supports multiple inheritance and mixins . The language supports extensive introspection of types and classes. Types can be read and comparedtypes are instances of type .  The attributes of an object can be extracted as a dictionary. Operators can be overloaded in Python by defining special member functionsfor instance, defining a method named __add__ on a class permits one to use the  operator on objects of that class. Literals [ edit ] Strings [ edit ] Python has various kinds of string literals . Normal string literals [ edit ] Either single or double quotes can be used to quote strings. Unlike in Unix shell languages, Perl or Perl-influenced languages such as Ruby or Groovy , single quotes and double quotes function identically, i.e. there is no string interpolation of foo expressions. However, interpolation can be done in various ways: with ""f-strings"" (since Python 3.6 [ 12 ] ), using the format method or the old  string-format operator. For instance, all of these Python statements: print ( f ""I just printed  num  pages to the printer  printer  "" ) print ( ""I just printed  pages to the printer  "" . format ( num , printer )) print ( ""I just printed 0 pages to the printer 1 "" . format ( num , printer )) print ( ""I just printed num pages to the printer printer "" . format ( num  num , printer  printer )) print ( ""I just printed s pages to the printer s ""  ( num , printer )) print ( ""I just printed (num)s pages to the printer (printer)s ""   ""num"" : num , ""printer"" : printer ) are equivalent to the Perl statement: print ""I just printed num pages to the printer printern"" They build a string using the variables num and printer . Multi-line string literals [ edit ] There are also multi-line strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quotes and function like here documents in Perl and Ruby . A simple example with variable interpolation (using the format method) is: print ( '''Dear recipient , I wish you to leave Sunnydale and never return. Not Quite Love, sender ''' . format ( sender  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" , recipient  ""Spike"" )) Raw strings [ edit ] Finally, all of the previously mentioned string types come in "" raw "" varieties (denoted by placing a literal r before the opening quote), which do no backslash-interpolation and hence are very useful for regular expressions ; compare ""-quoting"" in C . Raw strings were originally included specifically for regular expressions. Due to limitations of the tokenizer, raw strings may not have a trailing backslash. [ 13 ] Creating a raw string holding a Windows path ending with a backslash requires some variety of workaround (commonly, using forward slashes instead of backslashes, since Windows accepts both). Examples include:   A Windows path, even raw strings cannot end in a backslash  r ""C:FooBarBaz "" File ""stdin"" , line 1 r ""C:FooBarBaz ""  SyntaxError : EOL while scanning string literal  dos_path  r ""C:FooBarBaz ""  avoids the error by adding  dos_path . rstrip ()  and removing trailing space 'C:FooBarBaz'  quoted_dos_path  r '""  ""' . format ( dos_path )  quoted_dos_path '""C:FooBarBaz ""'   A regular expression matching a quoted string with possible backslash quoting  re . match ( r '""(([""  ]  .))""' , quoted_dos_path ) . group ( 1 ) . rstrip () 'C:FooBarBaz'  code  'foo(2, bar)'   Reverse the arguments in a two-arg function call  re . sub ( r '(([,]?),([ ,]?))' , r '(2, 1)' , code ) 'foo(2, bar)'   Note that this won't work if either argument has parens or commas in it. Concatenation of adjacent string literals [ edit ] String literals (using possibly different quote conventions) appearing contiguously and only separated by whitespace (including new lines), are allowed and are aggregated into a single longer string. [ 14 ] Thus title  ""One Good Turn: ""  'A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw' is equivalent to title  ""One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw"" Unicode [ edit ] Since Python 3.0, the default character set is UTF-8 both for source code and the interpreter. In UTF-8, unicode strings are handled like traditional byte strings. This example will work: s  """"  Hello in Greek print ( s ) Numbers [ edit ] Numeric literals in Python are of the normal sort, e.g. 0 , -1 , 3.4 , 3.5e-8 . Python has arbitrary-length integers and automatically increases their storage size as necessary. Prior to Python 3, there were two kinds of integral numbers: traditional fixed size integers and ""long"" integers of arbitrary size. The conversion to ""long"" integers was performed automatically when required, and thus the programmer usually didn't have to be aware of the two integral types. In newer language versions the distinction is completely gone and all integers behave like arbitrary-length integers. Python supports normal floating point numbers, which are created when a dot is used in a literal (e.g. 1.1 ), when an integer and a floating point number are used in an expression, or as a result of some mathematical operations (""true division"" via the / operator, or exponentiation with a negative exponent). Python also supports complex numbers natively.  Complex numbers are indicated with the J or j suffix, e.g. 3  4j . Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries [ edit ] Python has syntactic support for the creation of container types. Lists (class list ) are mutable sequences of items of arbitrary types, and can be created either with the special syntax a_list  [ 1 , 2 , 3 , ""a dog"" ] or using normal object creation a_second_list  [] a_second_list . append ( 4 ) a_second_list . append ( 5 ) Tuples (class tuple ) are immutable sequences of items of arbitrary types. There is also a special syntax to create tuples a_tuple  1 , 2 , 3 , ""four"" a_tuple  ( 1 , 2 , 3 , ""four"" ) Although tuples are created by separating items with commas, the whole construct is usually wrapped in parentheses to increase readability. An empty tuple is denoted by () , while a tuple with a single value can be created with (1,) . Sets (class set ) are mutable containers of hashable items [ 15 ] of arbitrary types, with no duplicates. The items are not ordered, but sets support iteration over the items. The syntax for set creation uses curly brackets some_set   0 , (), False  Python sets are very much like mathematical sets , and support operations like set intersection and union . Python also features a frozenset class for immutable sets, see Collection types . Dictionaries (class dict ) are mutable mappings tying keys and corresponding values. Python has special syntax to create dictionaries ( key: value ) a_dictionary   ""key 1"" : ""value 1"" , 2 : 3 , 4 : [] The dictionary syntax is similar to the set syntax, the difference is the presence of colons. The empty literal  results in an empty dictionary rather than an empty set, which is instead created using the non-literal constructor: set() . Operators [ edit ] Arithmetic [ edit ] Python includes the  , - ,  , / (""true division""), // ( floor division),  ( modulus ), and  ( exponentiation ) operators, with their usual mathematical precedence . In Python 3, x / y performs ""true division"", meaning that it always returns a float, even if both x and y are integers that divide evenly.  4 / 2 2.0 and // performs integer division or floor division , returning the floor of the quotient as an integer. In Python 2 (and most other programming languages), unless explicitly requested, x / y performed integer division , returning a float only if either input was a float. However, because Python is a dynamically-typed language, it was not always possible to tell which operation was being performed, which often led to subtle bugs, thus prompting the introduction of the // operator and the change in semantics of the / operator in Python 3. Comparison operators [ edit ] The comparison operators, i.e.  , ! ,  ,  ,  ,  , is , is not , in and not in [ 16 ] are used on all manner of values. Numbers, strings, sequences, and mappings can all be compared. In Python 3, disparate types (such as a str and an int ) do not have a consistent relative ordering, and attempts to compare these types raises a TypeError exception. While it was possible to compare disparate types in Python 2 (for example, whether a string was greater-than or less-than an integer), the ordering was undefined; this was considered a historical design quirk and was ultimately removed in Python 3. Chained comparison expressions such as a  b  c have roughly the meaning that they have in mathematics, rather than the unusual meaning found in C and similar languages. The terms are evaluated and compared in order. The operation has short-circuit semantics , meaning that evaluation is guaranteed to stop as soon as a verdict is clear: if a  b is false, c is never evaluated as the expression cannot possibly be true anymore. For expressions without side effects, a  b  c is equivalent to a  b and b  c . However, there is a substantial difference when the expressions have side effects. a  f(x)  b will evaluate f(x) exactly once, whereas a  f(x) and f(x)  b will evaluate it twice if the value of a is less than f(x) and once otherwise. Logical operators [ edit ] In all versions of Python, boolean operators treat zero values or empty values such as """" , 0 , None , 0.0 , [] , and  as false, while in general treating non-empty, non-zero values as true. The boolean values True and False were added to the language in Python 2.2.1 as constants (subclassed from 1 and 0 ) and were changed to be full blown keywords in Python 3. The binary comparison operators such as  and  return either True or False . The boolean operators and and or use minimal evaluation . For example, y  0 or x/y  100 will never raise a divide-by-zero exception. These operators return the value of the last operand evaluated, rather than True or False . Thus the expression (4 and 5) evaluates to 5 , and (4 or 5) evaluates to 4 . Functional programming [ edit ] As mentioned above, another strength of Python is the availability of a functional programming style. As may be expected, this makes working with lists and other collections much more straightforward. Comprehensions [ edit ] Main article: List comprehension One such construction is the list comprehension , which can be expressed with the following format: L  [ mapping_expression for element in source_list if filter_expression ] Using list comprehension to calculate the first five powers of two: powers_of_two  [ 2  n for n in range ( 1 , 6 )] The Quicksort algorithm can be expressed elegantly (albeit inefficiently) using list comprehensions: def qsort ( L ): if L  []: return [] pivot  L [ 0 ] return ( qsort ([ x for x in L [ 1 :] if x  pivot ])  [ pivot ]  qsort ([ x for x in L [ 1 :] if x  pivot ])) Python 2.7 [ 17 ] also supports set comprehensions [ 18 ] and dictionary comprehensions. [ 19 ] First-class functions [ edit ] In Python, functions are first-class objects that can be created and passed around dynamically. Python's limited support for anonymous functions is the lambda construct. An example is the anonymous function which squares its input, called with the argument of 5: f  lambda x : x  2 f ( 5 ) Lambdas are limited to containing an expression rather than statements , although control flow can still be implemented less elegantly within lambda by using short-circuiting, [ 20 ] and more idiomatically with conditional expressions. [ 21 ] Closures [ edit ] Python has had support for lexical closures since version 2.2. Here's an example function that returns a function that approximates the derivative of the given function: def derivative ( f , dx ): """"""Return a function that approximates the derivative of f using an interval of dx, which should be appropriately small. """""" def function ( x ): return ( f ( x  dx ) - f ( x )) / dx return function Python's syntax, though, sometimes leads programmers of other languages to think that closures are not supported. Variable scope in Python is implicitly determined by the scope in which one assigns a value to the variable, unless scope is explicitly declared with global or nonlocal . [ 22 ] Note that the closure's binding of a name to some value is not mutable from within the function. Given:  def foo ( a , b ): ... print ( f 'a:  a  ' ) ... print ( f 'b:  b  ' ) ... def bar ( c ): ... b  c ... print ( f 'b:  b  ' ) ... bar ( a ) ... print ( f 'b:  b  ' ) ...  foo ( 1 , 2 ) a: 1 b: 2 b: 1 b: 2 and you can see that b , as visible from the closure's scope, retains the value it had; the changed binding of b inside the inner function did not propagate out.  The way around this is to use a nonlocal b statement in bar . In Python 2 (which lacks nonlocal ), the usual workaround is to use a mutable value and change that value, not the binding.  E.g., a list with one element. Generators [ edit ] Introduced in Python 2.2 as an optional feature and finalized in version 2.3, generators are Python's mechanism for lazy evaluation of a function that would otherwise return a space-prohibitive or computationally intensive list. This is an example to lazily generate the prime numbers: from itertools import count def generate_primes ( stop_at  None ): primes  [] for n in count ( start  2 ): if stop_at is not None and n  stop_at : return  raises the StopIteration exception composite  False for p in primes : if not n  p : composite  True break elif p  2  n : break if not composite : primes . append ( n ) yield n When calling this function, the returned value can be iterated over much like a list: for i in generate_primes ( 100 ):  iterate over the primes between 0 and 100 print ( i ) for i in generate_primes ():  iterate over ALL primes indefinitely print ( i ) The definition of a generator appears identical to that of a function, except the keyword yield is used in place of return . However, a generator is an object with persistent state, which can repeatedly enter and leave the same scope. A generator call can then be used in place of a list, or other structure whose elements will be iterated over. Whenever the for loop in the example requires the next item, the generator is called, and yields the next item. Generators don't have to be infinite like the prime-number example above. When a generator terminates, an internal exception is raised which indicates to any calling context that there are no more values. A for loop or other iteration will then terminate. Generator expressions [ edit ] Further information: List comprehension Introduced in Python 2.4, generator expressions are the lazy evaluation equivalent of list comprehensions.  Using the prime number generator provided in the above section, we might define a lazy, but not quite infinite collection. from itertools import islice primes_under_million  ( i for i in generate_primes () if i  1000000 ) two_thousandth_prime  islice ( primes_under_million , 1999 , 2000 ) . next () Most of the memory and time needed to generate this many primes will not be used until the needed element is actually accessed.  Unfortunately, you cannot perform simple indexing and slicing of generators, but must use the itertools module or ""roll your own"" loops.  In contrast, a list comprehension is functionally equivalent, but is greedy in performing all the work: primes_under_million  [ i for i in generate_primes ( 2000000 ) if i  1000000 ] two_thousandth_prime  primes_under_million [ 1999 ] The list comprehension will immediately create a large list (with 78498 items, in the example, but transiently creating a list of primes under two million), even if most elements are never accessed.  The generator comprehension is more parsimonious. Dictionary and set comprehensions [ edit ] While lists and generators had comprehensions/expressions, in Python versions older than 2.7 the other Python built-in collection types (dicts and sets) had to be kludged in using lists or generators:  dict (( n , n  n ) for n in range ( 5 ))  0 : 0 , 1 : 1 , 2 : 4 , 3 : 9 , 4 : 16  Python 2.7 and 3.0 unified all collection types by introducing dictionary and set comprehensions, similar to list comprehensions:  [ n  n for n in range ( 5 )]  regular list comprehension [ 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 ]    n  n for n in range ( 5 )  set comprehension  0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 16     n : n  n for n in range ( 5 )  dict comprehension  0 : 0 , 1 : 1 , 2 : 4 , 3 : 9 , 4 : 16  Objects [ edit ] Python supports most object oriented programming (OOP) techniques. It allows polymorphism , not only within a class hierarchy but also by duck typing . Any object can be used for any type, and it will work so long as it has the proper methods and attributes. And everything in Python is an object, including classes, functions, numbers and modules. Python also has support for metaclasses , an advanced tool for enhancing classes' functionality. Naturally, inheritance , including multiple inheritance , is supported. Python has very limited support for private variables using name mangling which is rarely used in practice as information hiding is seen by some as unpythonic , in that it suggests that the class in question contains unaesthetic or ill-planned internals. The slogan ""we're all responsible users here"" is used to describe this attitude. [ 23 ] As is true for modules, classes in Python do not put an absolute barrier between definition and user, but rather rely on the politeness of the user not to ""break into the definition.""  9. Classes , The Python 2.6 Tutorial (2013) OOP doctrines such as the use of accessor methods to read data members are not enforced in Python. Just as Python offers functional-programming constructs but does not attempt to demand referential transparency , it offers an object system but does not demand OOP behavior. Moreover, it is always possible to redefine the class using properties (see Properties ) so that when a certain variable is set or retrieved in calling code, it really invokes a function call, so that spam.eggs  toast might really invoke spam.set_eggs(toast) . This nullifies the practical advantage of accessor functions, and it remains OOP because the property eggs becomes a legitimate part of the object's interface: it need not reflect an implementation detail. In version 2.2 of Python, ""new-style"" classes were introduced. With new-style classes, objects and types were unified, allowing the subclassing of types. Even entirely new types can be defined, complete with custom behavior for infix operators. This allows for many radical things to be done syntactically within Python. A new method resolution order for multiple inheritance was also adopted with Python 2.3.  It is also possible to run custom code while accessing or setting attributes, though the details of those techniques have evolved between Python versions. With statement [ edit ] The with statement handles resources, and allows users to work with the Context Manager protocol. [ 24 ] One function ( __enter__() ) is called when entering scope and another ( __exit__() ) when leaving. This prevents forgetting to free the resource and also handles more complicated situations such as freeing the resource when an exception occurs while it is in use. Context Managers are often used with files, database connections, test cases, etc. Properties [ edit ] Properties allow specially defined methods to be invoked on an object instance by using the same syntax as used for attribute access.  An example of a class defining some properties is: class MyClass : def __init__ ( self ): self . _a  None property def a ( self ): return self . _a a . setter  makes the property writable def a ( self , value ): self . _a  value Descriptors [ edit ] A class that defines one or more of the three special methods __get__(self, instance, owner) , __set__(self, instance, value) , __delete__(self, instance) can be used as a descriptor. Creating an instance of a descriptor as a class member of a second class makes the instance a property of the second class. [ 25 ] Class and static methods [ edit ] Python allows the creation of class methods and static methods via the use of the classmethod and staticmethod decorators .  The first argument to a class method is the class object instead of the self-reference to the instance.  A static method has no special first argument.  Neither the instance, nor the class object is passed to a static method. Exceptions [ edit ] Python supports (and extensively uses) exception handling as a means of testing for error conditions and other ""exceptional"" events in a program. Python style calls for the use of exceptions whenever an error condition might arise. Rather than testing for access to a file or resource before actually using it, it is conventional in Python to just go ahead and try to use it, catching the exception if access is rejected. Exceptions can also be used as a more general means of non-local transfer of control, even when an error is not at issue. For instance, the Mailman mailing list software, written in Python, uses exceptions to jump out of deeply nested message-handling logic when a decision has been made to reject a message or hold it for moderator approval. Exceptions are often used as an alternative to the if -block, especially in threaded situations. A commonly invoked motto is EAFP, or ""It is Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission,"" [ 26 ] which is attributed to Grace Hopper . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The alternative, known as LBYL, or ""Look Before You Leap"", explicitly tests for pre-conditions. [ 29 ] In this first code sample, following the LBYL approach, there is an explicit check for the attribute before access: if hasattr ( spam , 'eggs' ): ham  spam . eggs else : handle_missing_attr () This second sample follows the EAFP paradigm: try : ham  spam . eggs except AttributeError : handle_missing_attr () These two code samples have the same effect, although there will be performance differences.  When spam has the attribute eggs , the EAFP sample will run faster.  When spam does not have the attribute eggs (the ""exceptional"" case), the EAFP sample will run slower. The Python profiler can be used in specific cases to determine performance characteristics. If exceptional cases are rare, then the EAFP version will have superior average performance than the alternative. In addition, it avoids the whole class of time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) vulnerabilities, other race conditions , [ 28 ] [ 30 ] and is compatible with duck typing . A drawback of EAFP is that it can be used only with statements; an exception cannot be caught in a generator expression, list comprehension, or lambda function. Comments and docstrings [ edit ] Python has two ways to annotate Python code. One is by using comments to indicate what some part of the code does. Single-line comments begin with the hash character (  ) and continue until the end of the line. Comments spanning more than one line are achieved by inserting a multi-line string (with """""" or ''' as the delimiter on each end) that is not used in assignment or otherwise evaluated, but sits in between other statements. Commenting a piece of code: import sys def getline (): return sys . stdin . readline ()  Get one line and return it Commenting a piece of code with multiple lines: def getline (): """"""This function gets one line and returns it. As a demonstration, this is a multiline docstring. This full string can be accessed as getline.__doc__. """""" return sys . stdin . readline () Docstrings (documentation strings), that is, strings that are located alone without assignment as the first indented line within a module, class, method or function, automatically set their contents as an attribute named __doc__ , which is intended to store a human-readable description of the object's purpose, behavior, and usage. The built-in help function generates its output based on __doc__ attributes. Such strings can be delimited with "" or ' for single line strings, or may span multiple lines if delimited with either """""" or ''' which is Python's notation for specifying multi-line strings. However, the style guide for the language specifies that triple double quotes ( """""" ) are preferred for both single and multi-line docstrings. [ 31 ] Single-line docstring: def getline (): """"""Get one line from stdin and return it."""""" return sys . stdin . readline () Multi-line docstring: def getline (): """"""Get one line from stdin and return it. """""" return sys . stdin . readline () Docstrings can be as large as the programmer wants and contain line breaks . In contrast with comments, docstrings are themselves Python objects and are part of the interpreted code that Python runs. That means that a running program can retrieve its own docstrings and manipulate that information, but the normal usage is to give other programmers information about how to invoke the object being documented in the docstring. There are tools available that can extract the docstrings from Python code and generate documentation. Docstring documentation can also be accessed from the interpreter with the help() function, or from the shell with the pydoc command pydoc . The doctest standard module uses interactions copied from Python shell sessions into docstrings to create tests, whereas the docopt module uses them to define command-line options. Function annotations [ edit ] Function annotations (type hints) are defined in PEP 3107. [ 32 ] They allow attaching data to the arguments and return of a function. The behaviour of annotations is not defined by the language, and is left to third party frameworks. For example, a library could be written to handle static typing: [ 32 ] def haul ( item : Haulable ,  vargs : PackAnimal ) - Distance Decorators [ edit ] See also: Advice (programming) A decorator is any callable Python object that is used to modify a function, method or class definition.  A decorator is passed the original object being defined and returns a modified object, which is then bound to the name in the definition.  Python decorators were inspired in part by Java annotations , and have a similar syntax; the decorator syntax is pure syntactic sugar , using  as the keyword: viking_chorus def menu_item (): print ( ""spam"" ) is equivalent to def menu_item (): print ( ""spam"" ) menu_item  viking_chorus ( menu_item ) Decorators are a form of metaprogramming ; they enhance the action of the function or method they decorate. For example, in the sample below, viking_chorus might cause menu_item to be run 8 times (see Spam sketch ) for each time it is called: def viking_chorus ( myfunc ): def inner_func (  args ,  kwargs ): for i in range ( 8 ): myfunc (  args ,  kwargs ) return inner_func Canonical uses of function decorators are for creating class methods or static methods , adding function attributes, tracing , setting pre- and postconditions , and synchronization , [ 33 ] but can be used for far more, including tail recursion elimination , [ 34 ] memoization and even improving the writing of other decorators. [ 35 ] Decorators can be chained by placing several on adjacent lines: invincible favourite_colour ( ""Blue"" ) def black_knight (): pass is equivalent to def black_knight (): pass black_knight  invincible ( favourite_colour ( ""Blue"" )( black_knight )) or, using intermediate variables def black_knight (): pass blue_decorator  favourite_colour ( ""Blue"" ) decorated_by_blue  blue_decorator ( black_knight ) black_knight  invincible ( decorated_by_blue ) In the example above, the favourite_colour decorator factory takes an argument. Decorator factories must return a decorator, which is then called with the object to be decorated as its argument: def favourite_colour ( colour ): def decorator ( func ): def wrapper (): print ( colour ) func () return wrapper return decorator This would then decorate the black_knight function such that the colour, ""Blue"" , would be printed prior to the black_knight function running. Closure ensures that the colour argument is accessible to the innermost wrapper function even when it is returned and goes out of scope, which is what allows decorators to work. Despite the name, Python decorators are not an implementation of the decorator pattern . The decorator pattern is a design pattern used in statically-typed object-oriented programming languages to allow functionality to be added to objects at run time; Python decorators add functionality to functions and methods at definition time, and thus are a higher-level construct than decorator-pattern classes. The decorator pattern itself is trivially implementable in Python, because the language is duck typed , and so is not usually considered as such. [ clarification needed ] Easter eggs [ edit ] Users of curly bracket languages , such as C or Java , sometimes expect or wish Python to follow a block-delimiter convention. Brace-delimited block syntax has been repeatedly requested, and consistently rejected by core developers. The Python interpreter contains an easter egg that summarizes its developers' feelings on this issue. The code from __future__ import braces raises the exception SyntaxError: not a chance . The __future__ module is normally used to provide features from future versions of Python. Another hidden message, the Zen of Python (a summary of Python design philosophy ), is displayed when trying to import this . The message Hello world! is printed when the import statement import __hello__ is used. In Python 2.7, instead of Hello world! it prints Hello world... . Importing the antigravity module opens a web browser to xkcd comic 353 that portrays a humorous fictional use for such a module, intended to demonstrate the ease with which Python modules enable additional functionality. [ 36 ] In Python 3, this module also contains an implementation of the ""geohash"" algorithm, a reference to xkcd comic 426 .

How big is the place that we call home? How many other people call it home? To make sense of all of this information, certain tools and ways of thinking are necessary. The mathematical science called statistics is what helps us to deal with this information overload. Statistics is the study of numerical information, called data. Statisticians acquire, organize, and analyze data. Each part of this process is also scrutinized. The techniques of statistics are applied to a multitude of other areas of knowledge. Below is an introduction to some of the main topics throughout statistics. Populations and Samples One of the recurring themes of statistics is that we are able to say something about a large group based on the study of a relatively small portion of that group. The group as a whole is known as the population. The portion of the group that we study is the sample . As an example of this, suppose we wanted to know the average height of people living in the United States. We could try to measure over 300 million people, but this would be infeasible. It would be a logistical nightmare conduct the measurements in such a way that no one was missed and no one was counted twice. Due to the impossible nature of measuring everyone in the United States, we could instead use statistics. Rather than finding the heights of everyone in the population, we take a statistical sample of a few thousand. If we have sampled the population correctly, then the average height of the sample will be very close to the average height of the population. Acquiring Data To draw good conclusions, we need good data to work with. The way that we sample a population to obtain this data should always be scrutinized. Which kind of sample we use depends on what question were asking about the population. The most commonly used samples are: Simple Random Stratified Clustered Its equally important to know how the measurement of the sample is conducted. To go back to the above example, how do we acquire the heights of those in our sample? Do we let people report their own height on a questionnaire? Do several researchers throughout the country measure different people and report their results? Does a single researcher measure everyone in the sample with the same tape measure? Each of these ways of obtaining the data has its advantages and drawbacks. Anyone using the data from this study would want to know how it was obtained. Organizing the Data Sometimes there is a multitude of data, and we can literally get lost in all of the details. Its hard to see the forest for the trees. Thats why its important to keep our data well organized. Careful organization and graphical displays of the data help us to spot patterns and trends before we actually do any calculations. Since the way that we graphically present our data depends upon a variety of factors. Common graphs are: Pie charts or circle graphs Bar or pareto graphs Scatterplots Time plots Stem and leaf plots Box and whisker graphs In addition to these well-known graphs, there are others that are used in specialized situations. Descriptive Statistics One way to analyze data is called descriptive statistics. Here the goal is to calculate quantities that describe our data. Numbers called the mean, median and mode are all used to indicate the average or center of the data. The range and standard deviation are used to say how spread out the data is. More complicated techniques, such as correlation and regression describe data that is paired. Inferential Statistics When we begin with a sample and then try to infer something about the population, we are using inferential statistics . In working with this area of statistics, the topic of hypothesis testing arises. Here we see the scientific nature of the subject of statistics, as we state a hypothesis, then use statistical tools with our sample to determine the likelihood that we need to reject the hypothesis or not. This explanation is really just scratching the surface of this very useful part of statistics. Applications of Statistics It is no exaggeration to say that the tools of statistics are used by nearly every field of scientific research. Here are a few areas that rely heavily on statistics: Psychology Economics Medicine Advertising Demography The Foundations of Statistics Although some think of statistics as a branch of mathematics, it is better to think of it as a discipline that is founded upon mathematics. Specifically, statistics is built up from the field of mathematics known as probability. Probability gives us a way to determine how likely an event is to occur. It also gives us a way to talk about randomness. This is key to statistics because the typical sample needs to be randomly selected from the population. Probability was first studied in the 1700s by mathematicians such as Pascal and Fermat. The 1700s also marked the beginning of statistics. Statistics continued to grow from its probability roots and really took off in the 1800s. Today, its theoretical scope continues to be enlarged in what is known as mathematical statistics.

Expressions and operators by category For an alphabetical listing see the sidebar on the left. Primary expressions Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript. These expressions have the highest precedence (higher than operators ). this The this keyword refers to a special property of an execution context. Literals Basic null , boolean, number, and string literals. [] Array initializer/literal syntax.  Object initializer/literal syntax. function The function keyword defines a function expression. class The class keyword defines a class expression. function The function keyword defines a generator function expression. async function The async function defines an async function expression. async function The async function keywords define an async generator function expression. /abc/i Regular expression literal syntax. string Template literal syntax. ( ) Grouping operator. Left-hand-side expressions Left values are the destination of an assignment. Property accessors Member operators provide access to a property or method of an object ( object.property and object[""property""] ). ?. The optional chaining operator returns undefined instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish ( null or undefined ). new The new operator creates an instance of a constructor. new.target In constructors, new.target refers to the constructor that was invoked by new . import.meta An object exposing context-specific metadata to a JavaScript module. super The super keyword calls the parent constructor or allows accessing properties of the parent object. import() The import() syntax allows loading a module asynchronously and dynamically into a potentially non-module environment. Increment and decrement Postfix/prefix increment and postfix/prefix decrement operators. A Postfix increment operator. A-- Postfix decrement operator. A Prefix increment operator. --A Prefix decrement operator. Unary operators A unary operation is an operation with only one operand. delete The delete operator deletes a property from an object. void The void operator evaluates an expression and discards its return value. typeof The typeof operator determines the type of a given object.  The unary plus operator converts its operand to Number type. - The unary negation operator converts its operand to Number type and then negates it.  Bitwise NOT operator. ! Logical NOT operator. await Pause and resume an async function and wait for the promise's fulfillment/rejection. Arithmetic operators Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value.  Exponentiation operator.  Multiplication operator. / Division operator.  Remainder operator.  (Plus) Addition operator. - Subtraction operator. Relational operators A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.  (Less than) Less than operator.  (Greater than) Greater than operator.  Less than or equal operator.  Greater than or equal operator. instanceof The instanceof operator determines whether an object is an instance of another object. in The in operator determines whether an object has a given property. Note:  is not an operator, but the notation for Arrow functions . Equality operators The result of evaluating an equality operator is always of type boolean based on whether the comparison is true.  Equality operator. ! Inequality operator.  Strict equality operator. ! Strict inequality operator. Bitwise shift operators Operations to shift all bits of the operand.  Bitwise left shift operator.  Bitwise right shift operator.  Bitwise unsigned right shift operator. Binary bitwise operators Bitwise operators treat their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones) and return standard JavaScript numerical values.  Bitwise AND.  Bitwise OR.  Bitwise XOR. Binary logical operators Logical operators implement boolean (logical) values and have short-circuiting behavior.  Logical AND.  Logical OR. ?? Nullish Coalescing Operator. Conditional (ternary) operator (condition ? ifTrue : ifFalse) The conditional operator returns one of two values based on the logical value of the condition. Assignment operators An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.  Assignment operator.  Multiplication assignment. / Division assignment.  Remainder assignment.  Addition assignment. - Subtraction assignment  Left shift assignment.  Right shift assignment.  Unsigned right shift assignment.  Bitwise AND assignment.  Bitwise XOR assignment.  Bitwise OR assignment.  Exponentiation assignment.  Logical AND assignment.  Logical OR assignment. ?? Nullish coalescing assignment. [a, b]  arr ,  a, b   obj Destructuring allows you to assign the properties of an array or object to variables using syntax that looks similar to array or object literals. Yield operators yield Pause and resume a generator function. yield Delegate to another generator function or iterable object. Spread syntax ...obj Spread syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.

Comparison Operators Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. Given that x  5 , the table below explains the comparison operators: Operator Description Comparing Returns Try it  equal to x  8 false Try it  x  5 true Try it  x  ""5"" true Try it   equal value and equal type x  5 true Try it  x  ""5"" false Try it  ! not equal x ! 8 true Try it  ! not equal value or not equal type x ! 5 false Try it  x ! ""5"" true Try it  x ! 8 true Try it   greater than x  8 false Try it   less than x  8 true Try it   greater than or equal to x  8 false Try it   less than or equal to x  8 true Try it  How Can it be Used Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values  and take action depending on the result: if (age  18) text  ""Too young to buy alcohol""; You will learn more about the use of conditional statements in the next chapter of this tutorial. Logical Operators Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. Given that x  6 and y  3 , the table below explains the logical operators: Operator Description Example Try it  and (x  10  y  1) is true Try it   or (x  5  y  5) is false Try it  ! not !(x  y) is true Try it  Conditional (Ternary) Operator JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition. Syntax variablename  ( condition ) ? value1 : value2 Example let voteable  (age  18) ? ""Too young"":""Old enough""; Try it Yourself  If the variable age is a value below 18, the value of the variable voteable  will be ""Too young"", otherwise the value of voteable will be ""Old enough"". Comparing Different Types Comparing data of different types may give unexpected results. When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to  a number when doing the comparison. An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric  string converts to NaN which is always false . Case Value Try 2  12 true Try it  2  ""12"" true Try it  2  ""John"" false Try it  2  ""John"" false Try it  2  ""John"" false Try it  ""2""  ""12"" false Try it  ""2""  ""12"" true Try it  ""2""  ""12"" false Try it  When comparing two strings, ""2"" will be greater than ""12"", because  (alphabetically) 1 is less than 2. To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type  before comparison: age  Number(age); if (isNaN(age))  voteable  ""Input is not a number"";  else  voteable  (age  18) ? ""Too young"" : ""Old enough"";  Try it Yourself  The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??) The ?? operator returns the first argument if it is not nullish ( null or undefined ). Otherwise it returns the second argument. Example let name  null; let text  ""missing""; let result  name ?? text; Try it Yourself  The nullish operator is supported in all browsers since March 2020: Chrome 80 Edge 80 Firefox 72 Safari 13.1 Opera 67 Feb 2020 Feb 2020 Jan 2020 Mar 2020 Mar 2020 The Optional Chaining Operator (?.) The ?. operator returns undefined if an object is undefined or null (instead of throwing an error). Example // Create an object: const car  type:""Fiat"", model:""500"", color:""white""; // Ask for car name: document.getElementById(""demo"").innerHTML  car?.name; Try it Yourself  The optional chaining operator is supported in all browsers since March 2020: Chrome 80 Edge 80 Firefox 72 Safari 13.1 Opera 67 Feb 2020 Feb 2020 Jan 2020 Mar 2020 Mar 2020  Previous Next   1 Track your progress - it's free!

Variable values are called Variables . JavaScript Literals The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are: 1. Numbers are written with or  without decimals: 10.50 1001 Try it Yourself  2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes: ""John Doe"" 'John Doe' Try it Yourself  JavaScript Variables In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. JavaScript uses the keywords var , let and const to declare variables. An equal sign is used to assign values to variables. In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is  assigned (given) the value  6: let x; x  6; Try it Yourself  JavaScript Operators JavaScript uses arithmetic operators (  -  / ) to compute values: (5  6)  10 Try it Yourself  JavaScript uses an assignment operator (  ) to assign values to variables: let x, y; x  5; y  6; Try it Yourself  JavaScript Expressions An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators,  which computes to a value. The computation is called an evaluation. For example, 5  10 evaluates to 50: 5  10 Try it Yourself  Expressions can also contain variable values: x  10 Try it Yourself  The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings. For example, ""John""  "" ""  ""Doe"", evaluates to ""John Doe"": ""John""  "" ""  ""Doe"" Try it Yourself  JavaScript Keywords JavaScript keywords are used to  identify actions to be performed. The let keyword tells the browser to create variables: let x, y; x  5  6; y  x  10; Try it Yourself  The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables: var x, y; x  5  6; y  x  10; Try it Yourself  In these examples, using var or let will produce the same result. You will learn more about var and let later in this tutorial. JavaScript Comments Not all JavaScript statements are ""executed"". Code after double slashes // or between / and / is treated as a comment . Comments are ignored, and will not be  executed: let x  5;   // I will be executed // x  6;   I will  NOT be executed Try it Yourself  You will learn more about comments in a later chapter. JavaScript Identifiers / Names Identifiers are JavaScript names. Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions. The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages. A JavaScript name must begin with: A letter (A-Z or a-z) A dollar sign () Or an underscore (_) Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. Note Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names. This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers. JavaScript is Case Sensitive All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive . The variables lastName and lastname ,  are two different variables: let lastname, lastName; lastName  ""Doe""; lastname  ""Peterson""; Try it Yourself  JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let . JavaScript and Camel Case Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name: Hyphens: first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city. Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions. Underscore: first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city. Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case): FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity. Lower Camel Case: JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity. JavaScript Character Set JavaScript uses the Unicode character set. Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

Leanne Potts, Better Homes  Gardens , 11 Jan. 2025 See All Example Sentences for band Word History Etymology Noun (1) in senses 1  2, from Middle English band, bond something that constricts, from Old Norse band ; akin to Old English bindan to bind; in other senses, from Middle English bande strip, from Middle French, from Vulgar Latin binda , of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German binta fillet; akin to Old English bindan to bind, bend fetter   more at bind Noun (2) borrowed from Middle French bande ""troop, company of people,"" borrowed from Old Occitan banda, going back to Late Latin banda, plural of bandum ""flag, standard"" (attested in glosses), borrowed from Gothic bandwo ""sign, signal"" (or a cognate Germanic word), of uncertain origin Note: The meaning of the Latin word is well illustrated by the following passage from Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards ( Historia Langobardorum, 1.20), written in the late eighth century: ""Tato vero Rodulfi vexillum, quod bandum appellant, eiusque galeam, quam in bello gestare consueverat, abstulit."" (""Tato [a Lombard king] indeed carried off the banner of Rodulf [a king of the Heruli, a Germanic people], which they call bandum, and his helmet, which he had been accustomed to wear in battle"") The presumption is that the standard, which served as a rallying or assembly point for a group of soldiers, was applied to the group itself, and the meaning further generalized to any company of people.  The Gothic word bandwo is generally taken as descending from Indo-European b h eh 2 - ""shine, give light, appear"" (see fantasy entry 1 ) though derivational detail is lacking. D. Kroonen ( Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic, Brill, 2013) sees it as from b h onh 2 -tuh 2 , from the base of Germanic bannan- ""speak formally, call on, order"" (from b h onh 2 -e-, per Kroonen; see ban entry 1 ).

The Band The Band in 1969. Left to right: Richard Manuel , Garth Hudson , Levon Helm , Robbie Robertson and Rick Danko . Background information Also known as The Hawks Levon and the Hawks Canadian Squires The Crackers Origin Toronto , Ontario , Canada Woodstock, New York , U.S. Genres Roots rock Americana folk rock country rock [ 1 ] Discography The Band discography Years active 1957 ( 1957 ) 1977 19831999 Labels Capitol EMI Rhino Warner Bros. Past members Rick Danko Levon Helm Garth Hudson Richard Manuel Robbie Robertson Stan Szelest Richard Bell Jim Weider Randy Ciarlante The Band was a Canadian-American rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario , in 1957. It consisted of the Canadians Rick Danko (bass, guitar, vocals, fiddle), Garth Hudson (organ, keyboards, accordion, saxophone), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, vocals) and Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, percussion) and the American Levon Helm (drums, vocals, mandolin, guitar, bass). The Band's music combined elements of Americana , folk , rock, RB, jazz and country , which influenced artists including George Harrison , Elton John , the Grateful Dead , Eric Clapton , and Wilco . Between 1958 and 1963, the group was known as the Hawks and were the backing band for rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins . In the mid-1960s, they gained recognition for backing Bob Dylan on his 1966 concert tour as Dylan's first electric band. After leaving Dylan and changing their name to the Band, they released their 1968 debut Music from Big Pink and its succeeding album, 1969's The Band to  critical acclaim and commercial success. According to AllMusic , Music from Big Pink influenced several generations of musicians. Pink Floyd member Roger Waters deemed it the ""second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll"", [ 2 ] and music journalist Al Aronowitz called it ""country soul ... a sound never heard before"". [ 3 ] Their most popular songs included "" The Weight "" (1968), "" The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down "" (1969), and "" Up on Cripple Creek "" (1969). The Band performed their farewell concert on November 25, 1976. Footage from the event was released in 1978 as the concert film The Last Waltz , directed by Martin Scorsese .  It would be the last performance of the original five members.  After five years apart, Danko, Hudson, Helm, and Manuel reunited in 1983 for a tour without Robertson, who had taken up a new career as a producer and composer for film soundtracks. Manuel died in 1986, but the remaining three members continued to tour and occasionally released new albums of studio material until Danko's death in 1999, after which the remaining members broke up for good. Helm would go on to have a successful solo career, winning multiple Grammy Awards in the folk and Americana categories until his 2012 death, while Hudson worked as a featured session musician. Robertson died in 2023 and Hudson in 2025. Jim Weider and Randy Ciarlante , who each joined the group at much later dates in the 1980s and 1990s, [ 4 ] are the only surviving members of the Band. Music critic Bruce Eder described the Band as ""one of the most popular and influential rock groups in the world, their music embraced by critics ... as seriously as the music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones ."" [ 5 ] The Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them 50th on its list of the "" 100 Greatest Artists of All Time "", [ 8 ] and ranked ""The Weight"" 41st on its list of the "" 500 Greatest Songs of All Time "". [ 9 ] In 2008, the group received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and in 2014, were inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] History [ edit ] 19571964: The Hawks [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: ""The Band""  news  newspapers  books  scholar  JSTOR ( February 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The future members of the Band first played together as the Hawks, the backing group for Toronto -based rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins . Levon Helm began playing with the group in 1957, then became their fulltime drummer after graduating from high school in 1958. Helm journeyed with Hawkins from Arkansas to Ontario, where they were joined by Robbie Robertson , Rick Danko , Richard Manuel , and finally Garth Hudson . Latter-day Band member Stan Szelest was also in the group at that time. Hawkins's act was popular in and around Toronto and nearby Hamilton, [ 12 ] and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition: when a promising band appeared, Hawkins would hire their best musicians for his own group; Robertson, Danko, and Manuel came under Hawkins's tutelage this way. While most of the Hawks were eager to join Hawkins's group, getting Hudson to join was more difficult. Having earned a college degree, Hudson planned on a career as a music teacher, and was only interested in playing rock music as a hobby. The Hawks admired his wild, full-bore organ style and asked him repeatedly to join. Hudson finally agreed, under the condition that the Hawks each pay him 10 per week to be their instructor and purchase a new state-of-the-art Lowrey organ ; all music theory questions were directed to Hudson. There is a view that jazz is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd Street, and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good. Garth Hudson in The Last Waltz With Hawkins, they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving Toronto music scene. Hawkins regularly convened all-night rehearsals following long club shows, with the result that the young musicians quickly developed their instrumental skills. In late 1963, the group split from Hawkins over personal differences. They had grown tired of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material, and they were also wary of Hawkins's heavy-handed leadership. He would fine the Hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs (fearing it might reduce the numbers of ""available"" girls who came to performances) or if they smoked marijuana . Robertson later said, ""Eventually, [Hawkins] built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically."" [ 13 ] Upon leaving Hawkins, the group was briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet, with a sixth member, saxophonist Jerry Penfound, and then as Levon and the Hawks after Penfound's departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name the Canadian Squires, but they returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for Atco later that year. [ 14 ] Also in 1965, Helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson . They wanted to record with him, offering to become his backing band, but Williamson died not long after their meeting. Later in 1965, American musician Bob Dylan hired the group as his backing band for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966 . [ 15 ] Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with help from Dylan and his manager, Albert Grossman , to Saugerties, New York , where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes , the basis for their 1968 debut album, Music from Big Pink . Because they were always referred to simply as ""the band"" to various frontmen and the locals in Woodstock, Helm said the name ""The Band"" worked well when the group came into its own. [ 16 ] [ a ] The group decided on it as their official name and began performing under it from 1968 onward. Dylan continued to collaborate with the Band over the course of their career, most notably in a joint 1974 tour . [ 18 ] 19651967: With Bob Dylan [ edit ] ""Big Pink"" in 2006 In late summer 1965, Bob Dylan was looking for a backup band for his first U.S. ""electric"" tour. Levon and the Hawks were recommended by blues singer John P. Hammond , who earlier that year had recorded with Helm, Hudson and Robertson on his Vanguard album So Many Roads . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Around the same time, one of their friends from Toronto, Mary Martin, was working as secretary to Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman . She told Dylan to visit the group at Le Coq d'Or Tavern, a club on Yonge Street , in Torontothough Robertson recollects it was the Friar's Tavern, just down the street. [ 21 ] Her advice to Dylan: ""You gotta see these guys."" [ 22 ] After hearing the Band play and meeting with Robertson, Dylan invited Helm and Robertson to join his backing band. After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates and told him that they would continue with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and rhythm and blues group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become. [ 23 ] With Dylan, the Hawks played a series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as ""Bob Dylan and the Band"". The tours were marked by Dylan's reportedly copious use of amphetamines . Some, though not all, of the Hawks joined in the excesses. [ 24 ] Most of the concerts were met with heckling and disapproval from folk music purists. Helm was so affected by the negative reception that he left the tour after a little more than one month and sat out the rest of that year's concerts, as well as the world tour in 1966. [ 25 ] Helm spent much of this period working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. [ 26 ] During and between tours, Dylan and the Hawks attempted several recording sessions, but with less than satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable single ("" Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window? ""), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what was intended to be Dylan's next album, Blonde on Blonde , resulted in "" One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later) "", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album. [ 27 ] On ""One of Us Must Know"", Dylan was backed by drummer Bobby Gregg , bassist Danko (or Bill Lee ), [ b ] guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin , and Al Kooper (who was more a guitarist than an organist) playing organ. [ 28 ] Frustrated by the slow progress in the New York studio, Dylan accepted the suggestion of producer Bob Johnston and moved the recording sessions to Nashville. In Nashville, Robertson's guitar was prominent on the Blonde on Blonde recordings, especially in the song "" Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat "", but the other members of the Hawks did not attend the sessions. During the European leg of their 1966 world tour, Mickey Jones replaced Sandy Konikoff on drums. Dylan and the Hawks played at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester on May 17, 1966. The gig became legendary when, near the end of Dylan's electric set, an audience member shouted "" Judas !"" After a pause, Dylan replied, ""I don't believe you. You're a liar!"" He then turned to the Hawks and said, ""Play it fucking loud!"" With that, they launched into an acidic version of "" Like a Rolling Stone "". [ 29 ] The Manchester performance was widely bootlegged (and mistakenly placed at the Royal Albert Hall ). In a 1971 review for Creem , critic Dave Marsh wrote, ""My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable."" [ 30 ] When the concert finally saw an official release as The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The ""Royal Albert Hall"" Concert in 1998, critic Richie Unterberger declared the record ""an important document of rock history."" [ 31 ] On July 29, 1966, while on a break from touring, Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident that precipitated his retreat into semi-seclusion in Woodstock , New York . [ 32 ] For a while, the Hawks returned to the bar and roadhouse touring circuit, sometimes backing other singers, including a brief stint with Tiny Tim . Dylan invited the Hawks to join him in Woodstock in February 1967, [ 33 ] and Danko, Hudson, and Manuel rented a large pink house, which they named "" Big Pink "", in nearby West Saugerties, New York . The next month (initially without Helm) they commenced recording a much-bootlegged and influential series of demos, initially at Dylan's house in Woodstock and later at Big Pink, which were released partially on LP as The Basement Tapes in 1975 and in full in 2014 . A track-by-track review of the bootleg was detailed by Jann Wenner in Rolling Stone , in which the band members were explicitly named and given the collective name ""the Crackers"". [ 34 ] While Helm was not involved in the initial recording, he did perform in later sessions and in overdubs recorded in 1975 before the album's release. 19681972: Initial success with Music from Big Pink self-titled album [ edit ] L to R: Danko, Helm and Manuel on tour in Hamburg, Germany, in 1971 The sessions with Dylan ended in October 1967, with Helm having rejoined the group by that time, and the Hawks began writing their own songs at Big Pink. When they went into the recording studio, they still did not have a name for themselves. Stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name ""The Band"". In The Last Waltz , Manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either ""the Honkies "" or ""the Crackers "" (which they used when backing Dylan for a January 1968 concert tribute to Woody Guthrie ), but these names were vetoed by their record label; Robertson suggests that during their time with Dylan everyone just referred to them as ""the band"" and the name stuck. Initially they disliked the moniker, but eventually they grew to like it, thinking it both humble and presumptuous. In 1969, Rolling Stone referred to them as ""the band from Big Pink"". [ 35 ] Their debut album, Music from Big Pink was released in July 1968 and was widely acclaimed. It included three songs written or co-written by Dylan ("" This Wheel's on Fire "", "" Tears of Rage "" and "" I Shall Be Released "") as well as "" The Weight "", which became one of their best-known songs after it was used in the 1969 film Easy Rider . While a thematic continuity ran through the music, the musical style varied from song to song. Hudson in 1971 In early 1969, after the success of Music from Big Pink , the Band went on tour, starting with an appearance at Winterland Ballroom . They performed at the Woodstock Festival (their performance was not included in the famed Woodstock film because of legal complications), and later that year they performed with Dylan at the UK Isle of Wight Festival (several songs from which were subsequently included on Dylan's Self Portrait album). That same year, they left for Los Angeles to record their follow-up, The Band (1969). From their rustic appearance on the cover to the songs and arrangements within, the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day. [ citation needed ] Several other artists had already made similar stylistic moves, notably Dylan, on John Wesley Harding (1967), which was written during the Basement Tapes sessions, and the Byrds , on Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1968), which featured two Basement Tapes covers. The Band featured songs that evoked old-time rural America, from the Civil War in "" The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down "" to the unionization of farm workers in "" King Harvest (Has Surely Come) "". These first two records were produced by John Simon , who was practically a group member: he aided in arrangements in addition to playing occasional piano and tuba . Simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured so effectively on the first two albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively using their limited technique. Rolling Stone lavished praise on the Band in this era, giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazine's history [ citation needed ] ; Greil Marcus 's articles contributed to the Band's mystique. The Band was also featured on the cover of Time (January 12, 1970), the first rock group after the Beatles, over two years earlier, to achieve this rare distinction. [ 36 ] David Attie 's unused photographs for this coveramong the very few studio portraits taken during the Band's primehave only recently been discovered, and were featured in Daniel Roher's Robbie Robertson documentary Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band , as well as having their own four-page spread in Harvey Kubernik and Ken Kubernik's The Story of the Band: From Big Pink to The Last Waltz  (Sterling Publishing, 2018). [ 37 ] A critical and commercial triumph, The Band , along with works by the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers , established a musical template (dubbed country rock ) that paved the way to the Eagles . [ citation needed ] Both Big Pink and The Band also influenced their musical contemporaries. Eric Clapton and George Harrison cited the Band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clapton later revealed that he wanted to join the group. [ 38 ] While he never did join, he recruited all of the members of the Band as well as other roots rock performers for his 1976 album No Reason to Cry . Following their second album, the Band embarked on their first tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. Stage Fright (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer Todd Rundgren and recorded on stage at the iconic Woodstock Playhouse . As with their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited with most of the songwriting. Initial critical reaction was positive, but it was seen as a disappointment from the previous two albums for various reasons. After recording Stage Fright , the Band was among the acts participating in the Festival Express , an all-star rock concert tour of Canada by train that also included Janis Joplin , the Grateful Dead and future Band member Richard Bell (at the time he was a member of Joplin's band). In the concert documentary film, released in 2003, Danko can be seen participating in a drunken jam session with Jerry Garcia , Bob Weir , John Dawson , and Joplin while singing ""Ain't No More Cane"". At about this time, Robertson began exerting greater control over the Band, a point of contention between him and Helm. Helm charges Robertson with authoritarianism and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because Danko, Helm, and Manuel were becoming more unreliable due to their heroin usage. [ 39 ] Robertson insists he did his best to coax Manuel into writing more songs, only to see him descend into addiction. Despite mounting problems among the group members, the Band forged ahead with their next album, Cahoots (1971). Cahoots featured Dylan's "" When I Paint My Masterpiece "", ""4 Pantomime"" (with Van Morrison ), and "" Life Is a Carnival "", the last featuring a horn arrangement by Allen Toussaint . Toussaint's contribution was a critical addition to the Band's next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: "" Holy Cow "" on Moondog Matinee and ""You See Me"" on Jubilation . In late December 1971, the Band recorded the live album Rock of Ages , which was released in the summer of 1972. On Rock of Ages , they were bolstered by the addition of a horn section, with arrangements written by Toussaint. Dylan appeared on stage on New Year's Eve and performed four songs with the group, including a version of ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"". 19731975: Move to Shangri-La [ edit ] Bob Dylan and the Band in Chicago, 1974: (left to right) Danko, Robertson, Dylan and Helm In 1973, the Band released the covers album Moondog Matinee . There was no tour in support of the album, which garnered mixed reviews. However, on July 28, 1973, they played at Summer Jam at Watkins Glen , a massive concert that took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside Watkins Glen, New York . The event, which was attended by over 600,000 fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band . It was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan. [ 40 ] By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the first order of business was backing Dylan on his album Planet Waves . The album was released concurrently with their joint 1974 tour, in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the tour was documented on the live album Before the Flood ,. During this time, the Band brought in Planet Waves producer Rob Fraboni to help design a music studio for the group. By 1975, the studio, Shangri-La , was completed. That year, the Band recorded and released Northern Lights  Southern Cross , their first album of new material since 1971. All eight songs were written solely by Robertson. Despite comparatively poor record sales, the album is favored by critics and fans. [ citation needed ] Levon Helm regards this album highly in his book, This Wheel's on Fire : ""It was the best album we had done since The Band ."" The album also produced more experimentation from Hudson, switching to synthesizers, showcased on ""Jupiter Hollow"". 19761978: The Last Waltz [ edit ] Main article: The Last Waltz The Band with guests at the Last Waltz concert. Photo: David Gans By the mid-1970s, Robbie Robertson was weary of touring. After Northern Lights  Southern Cross failed to meet commercial expectations, much of the group's 1976 tour was confined to theaters and smaller arenas in secondary markets (including the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium , the Long Island Arena and the Champlain Valley Expo in Essex Junction, Vermont ), culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant ZZ Top at the Nashville Fairgrounds in September. [ 41 ] In early September, Richard Manuel suffered a severe neck injury in a boating accident in Texas, [ 42 ] prompting Robertson to urge the Band to retire from live performances after staging a ""farewell concert"" known as The Last Waltz . Following an October 30 appearance on Saturday Night Live , the event, including turkey dinner for the audience of 5,000, was held on November 25 ( Thanksgiving Day ) of 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco , California , [ 43 ] and featured a horn section with arrangements by Allen Toussaint and an all-star lineup of guests, including Canadian artists Joni Mitchell and Neil Young . Two of the guests were fundamental to the Band's existence and growth: Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan. Other guests they admired (and in most cases had worked with before) included Muddy Waters , Dr. John , Van Morrison, Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton, Ron Wood , Bobby Charles , Neil Diamond , and Paul Butterfield . The concert was filmed by Robertson's friend, filmmaker Martin Scorsese . [ 44 ] In 1977, the Band released their seventh studio album Islands , which fulfilled their record contract with Capitol so that a planned Last Waltz film and album could be released on the Warner Bros. label. Islands contained a mix of originals and covers, and was the last with the Band's original lineup. That same year, the group recorded soundstage performances with country singer Emmylou Harris (""Evangeline"") and gospel-soul group the Staple Singers (""The Weight""); Scorsese combined these new performancesas well as interviews he had conducted with the groupwith the 1976 concert footage. The resulting concert film  documentary was released in 1978, along with a three-LP soundtrack . Helm later wrote about The Last Waltz in his autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire , in which he made the case that it had been primarily Robbie Robertson's project and that Robertson had forced the Band's breakup on the rest of the group. [ 45 ] Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: ""I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about itand if this is only my statement, not theirs, I'll accept that. They're saying, 'Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.' Well, fine. I'll take the best music film that's ever been made, and make it my statement. I don't have any problems with that. None at all."" [ 46 ] The original quintet would perform together one last time: on March 1, 1978 after the late set of a Rick Danko solo show at The Roxy , the group performed ""Stage Fright"", ""The Shape I'm In"", and ""The Weight"" for an encore. [ 47 ] Although the members of the group intended to continue working on studio projects, they drifted apart after the release of Islands in March 1977. 19831989: Reformation and the death of Richard Manuel [ edit ] The Band resumed touring in 1983 without Robertson. Accomplished musician from Woodstock, NY, Jim Weider became lead guitarist. Robertson had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. As a result of their diminished popularity, they performed in theaters and clubs as headliners and took support slots in larger venues for onetime peers such as the Grateful Dead and Crosby, Stills and Nash . After a performance in Winter Park, Florida , on March 4, 1986, Manuel hanged himself , aged 42, in his motel room. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] He had suffered for many years from alcoholism and drug addiction and had been clean and sober for several years beginning in 1978 but had begun drinking and using drugs again by 1984. [ 50 ] Manuel's position as pianist was filled by old friend Stan Szelest (who died not long after) and then by Richard Bell. Bell had played with Ronnie Hawkins after the departure of the original Hawks, and was best known from his days as a member of Janis Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band . The Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the 1989 Juno Awards , where Robertson was reunited with original members Danko and Hudson. With Canadian country rock superstars Blue Rodeo as a back-up band, Music Express called the 1989 Juno appearance a symbolic ""passing of the torch"" from the Band to Blue Rodeo. 19901999: Return to final recording and the death of Rick Danko [ edit ] In 1990, Capitol Records began to re-release the records from the 1970s. [ 51 ] The remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a succession of musicians filling Manuel's and Robertson's roles. The Band appeared at Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert in New York City in October 1992, where they performed their version of Dylan's "" When I Paint My Masterpiece "". In 1993, the group released their eighth studio album, Jericho . Jericho was their first album recorded since The Last Waltz 17 years prior, and also their first studio album since Islands . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Without Robbie Robertson as primary lyricist, much of the songwriting for the album came from outside of the group. Also that year, the Band, along with Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, and other performers, appeared at U.S. President Bill Clinton 's 1993 ""Blue Jean Bash"" inauguration party. [ 54 ] In 1994, the Band performed at Woodstock '94 . Later that year Robertson appeared with Danko and Hudson as the Band for the second time since the original group broke up. The occasion was the induction of the Band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Helm, who had been at odds with Robertson for years over accusations of stolen songwriting credits, did not attend. [ 55 ] In February 1996, the Band with the Crickets recorded "" Not Fade Away "", released on the tribute album Not Fade Away (Remembering Buddy Holly) . The Band released two more albums after Jericho : High on the Hog (1996) and Jubilation (1998), the latter of which included guest appearances by Eric Clapton and John Hiatt . Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years but he eventually regained the use of his voice. In 1998, the group revealed they were working on a follow-up album to Jubilation that has not been released. [ 56 ] The final song the group recorded together was their 1999 version of Bob Dylan's "" One Too Many Mornings "", which they contributed to the Dylan tribute album Tangled Up in Blues . On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at the age of 55. Following his death, the Band broke up for good. The final configuration of the group included Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar). 2000present [ edit ] In 2002, Robertson bought all other former members' financial interests in the group (with the exception of Helm's), [ 57 ] giving him major control of the presentation of the group's material, including latter-day compilations. Richard Bell died of multiple myeloma in June 2007. The Band received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award on February 9, 2008, [ 58 ] but there was no reunion of former members. In honor of the event, Helm held a Midnight Ramble in Woodstock. [ 59 ] He continued to perform and released several albums. On April 17, 2012, it was announced via Helm's official website that he was in the ""final stages of cancer""; [ 60 ] he died two days later. [ 61 ] In December 2020, it was announced that the third album of the Band, Stage Fright , would get an expanded reissue. The album has alternate versions of some songs. [ 62 ] Robbie Robertson died at the age of 80 on August 9, 2023, after battling prostate cancer. [ 63 ] Garth Hudson, the last living original member, died at the age of 87 on January 21, 2025. [ 64 ] Members' other endeavours [ edit ] In 1977, Rick Danko released his eponymous debut solo album , which featured the other four members of the Band on various tracks. In 1984, Danko joined members of the Byrds , the Flying Burrito Brothers, and others in the touring company that made up ""The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration"". Several members of the tour performed solo songs to start the show, including Danko, who performed ""Mystery Train"". Danko also released two collaborative albums with Eric Andersen and Jonas Fjeld , along with some live and compilation albums in the 1990s and 2000s; many of the latter records were produced by Aaron L. Hurwitz and are on the Breeze Hill/Woodstock Records Label. [ 65 ] In the late 1970s and 1980s, Helm released several solo albums and toured with a band called Levon Helm and the RCO Allstars. He also began an acting career with his role as Loretta Lynn 's father in Coal Miner's Daughter . Helm received praise for his narration and supporting role opposite Sam Shepard in 1983's The Right Stuff . In 1997, a CD by Levon Helm and the Crowmatix, Souvenir , was released. [ 66 ] Beginning sometime in the 1990s, Helm regularly performed Midnight Ramble concerts at his home and studio in Woodstock, New York, and toured. [ 67 ] In 2007 Helm released a new album, an homage to his southern roots called Dirt Farmer , which was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album on February 9, 2008. Electric Dirt followed in 2009 and won the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Americana Album . His 2011 live album Ramble at the Ryman won in the same category. [ 68 ] After he left the Band, Robbie Robertson became a music producer and wrote film soundtracks (including acting as music supervisor for several of Scorsese's films) before beginning a solo career with his Daniel Lanois -produced eponymous album in 1987. Robertson continued mostly scoring films until his death in 2023. [ 69 ] Hudson released two solo CDs, The Sea to the North in 2001, produced by Aaron (Professor Louie) Hurwitz, and Live at the Wolf in 2005, both featuring his wife, Maud, on vocals. He also kept busy as an in-demand studio musician. He featured extensively on recordings of the Call and country-indie star Neko Case. Hudson contributed an original electronic score to an off-Broadway production of Dragon Slayers , written by Stanley Keyes and directed by Brad Mays in 1986 at the Union Square Theatre in New York, which was restaged with a new cast in Los Angeles in 1990. In 2010, Hudson released Garth Hudson Presents: A Canadian Celebration of The Band , featuring Canadian artists covering songs that were recorded by the Band. In 2012, Jim Weider launched The Weight Band , performing covers of the Band's music, alongside former members of the Levon Helm Band and Rick Danko Group. The Weight Band performed in a nationally broadcast PBS special, Infinity Hall Live, [ 70 ] featuring new music. Following the show, the band announced a self-titled album of new music. The Weight Band also hosts Camp Cripple Creek, which celebrates the legacy of the Woodstock Sound. Past guests have included Jackie Greene , Music from Big Pink producer John Simon and John Sebastian . [ 71 ] Manuel had few projects outside the Band; he and the rest of the Band contributed to Eric Clapton's 1976 album No Reason to Cry . It included an original composition by Manuel and featured his vocals and drumming on several tracks. Manuel later worked on several film scores with Hudson and Robertson, including Raging Bull and The Color of Money . Whispering Pines: Live at the Getaway was released in 2002. Musical style [ edit ] The Band in Hamburg, 1971: (left to right) Manuel, Danko, Robertson, and Helm The Band's style ""thematically and musically fuse[d] the past and the present"" by combining various genres. [ 72 ] Although primarily incorporating old country music and early rock and roll , the rhythm section often was reminiscent of Stax - or Motown -style rhythm and blues, and Robertson cites Curtis Mayfield and the Staple Singers as major influences, resulting in a synthesis of many musical genres . Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to the Band: Helm's Southern accent was prevalent in his raw and powerful vocals, Danko sang tenor with a distinctively choppy enunciation, and Manuel alternated between falsetto and a soulful baritone. The singers regularly blended in harmonies . Though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as the Band's ""lead"" singer. [ 73 ] Every member was a multi-instrumentalist. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of timbres from his Lowrey organ . Helm's drumming was often praised: critic Jon Carroll declared that Helm was ""the only drummer who can make you cry,"" while prolific session drummer Jim Keltner admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques. [ 74 ] Producer John Simon is often cited as a ""sixth member"" of the Band for producing and playing on Music from Big Pink , co-producing and playing on The Band , and playing on other songs up through the Band's 1993 reunion album Jericho . [ 75 ] Copyright controversy [ edit ] Robertson is credited as writer or co-writer of the majority of the Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band , Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that the Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: ""I think Levon's book hits the nail on the head about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when the Band stopped being the Band ... I'm truly friends with everybody but, heyit could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble."" [ 76 ] Robertson denied that Helm had written any of the songs attributed to Robertson. [ 77 ] The studio albums recorded by Levon Helm as a solo artist Levon Helm (1978), American Son , Levon Helm (1982), Dirt Farmer , and Electric Dirt contain only one song crediting him as songwriter (""Growin' Trade"", co-written with Larry Campbell ). [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Legacy [ edit ] The Band ""ushered in the roots-rock of the '70s, embodying Americana in a way that no one else has approached,"" according to Mark Deming of AllMusic . He further explained, ""Their work reflected the influences of country, blues, folk, and other forms of American roots music in a way that was fresh, organic, and innovative, and showed a creative maturity that was a revelation in the psychedelic era."" [ 72 ] The Band has influenced numerous bands, songwriters and performers, including the Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Crosby, Stills, Nash  Young, [ 80 ] Led Zeppelin , [ 81 ] Elvis Costello , [ 82 ] Elton John , [ 83 ] Phish , [ 84 ] and Pink Floyd . [ 85 ] The album Music from Big Pink , in particular, is credited with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream . In his introduction of the Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 he had heard the album, ""and it changed my life."" [ 86 ] The band Nazareth took their name from a line in ""The Weight"". Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention 's Liege and Lief , and journalist John Harris has asserted that the Band's debut also influenced the spirit of the Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet . [ 87 ] [ c ] George Harrison said that his song "" All Things Must Pass "" was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. [ 88 ] Meanwhile, ""The Weight"" has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, ""We certainly didn't want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama , and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll."" [ 89 ] In the 1990s, a new generation of bands influenced by the Band began to gain popularity, including Counting Crows , the Wallflowers , and the Black Crowes . Counting Crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late Richard Manuel , "" If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead) "", from their album Hard Candy . The Black Crowes frequently cover songs by the Band during live performances, such as ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"", which appears on their DVD/CD Freak 'n' Roll into the Fog . [ 90 ] They have also recorded at Helm's studio in Woodstock. The Hold Steady was formed after members Craig Finn and Tad Kubler watched The Last Waltz . [ 91 ] Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson are name-checked in the lyrics of ""The Swish"" from the Hold Steady's 2004 debut album Almost Killed Me . [ 92 ] Also that year, southern rock -revivalists Drive-By Truckers released the Jason Isbell penned track ""Danko/Manuel"" on the album The Dirty South . The Band also inspired Grace Potter, of Grace Potter and the Nocturnals , to form the band in 2002. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Potter said, ""The Band blew my mind. I thought if this is what Matt [Burr] meant when he said 'Let's start a rock 'n' roll band,' ... that was the kind of rock 'n' roll band I could believe in."" [ 93 ] A tribute album, entitled Endless Highway: The Music of the Band , released in January 2007, included contributions from My Morning Jacket , Death Cab for Cutie , Gomez , Guster , Bruce Hornsby , Jack Johnson and ALO , Lee Ann Womack , the Allman Brothers Band, Blues Traveler , Jakob Dylan , Rosanne Cash , and others. Members of Wilco , Clap Your Hands Say Yeah , the Shins , Dr Dog , Yellowbirds , Ween , Furthur , and other bands staged The Complete Last Waltz in 2012 and 2013. [ 94 ] Their performances included all 41 songs from the original 1976 concert in sequence, even those edited out of the film. Musical director Sam Cohen of Yellowbirds claims ""the movie is pretty ingrained in me. I've watched it probably 100 times."" [ 94 ] An incarnation of the Band's legacy, The Weight Band, originated inside the barn of Levon Helm in 2012 when Jim Weider and Randy Ciarlante, both former members of the Band, were performing ""Songs of the Band"" with Garth Hudson , Jimmy Vivino and Byron Isaacs. In July 2017, PBS's Infinity Hall Live program began airing a televised performance by The Weight Band, featuring Band covers and new music by the band. [ 95 ] Every year on the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving, Dayton, Ohio NPR affiliate WYSO and The Dayton Art Institute host a tribute to The Last Waltz . [ 96 ] Frequently selling out, the show features more than 30 local musicians. A similar event takes place annually in Madison, Wisconsin, on the Saturday night after Thanksgiving. The Band are the subjects of the 2019 documentary film Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band , which premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival . [ 97 ] The Band is the subject of an extensive historical podcast, The Band: A History , currently covering the entire history of the group.

'the one endowed with auspicious signs', IAST : Lakmaa ), also known as Laxmana , Lakhan , Saumitra , and Ramanuja , is the younger brother of Rama in the Hindu epic Ramayana . He is considered as an incarnation of Shesha , the lord of serpents. [ 2 ] Lakshmana was married to Urmila , and is known for his loyalty and dedication towards Rama. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Lakshmana was born to King Dasharatha of Ayodhya and Queen Sumitra . Shatrughna , is his twin brother. He was married to Urmila , after his brother Rama married Sita in her swayamvara. Lakshmana devoted himself to Rama since childhood and accompanied him during his fourteen-year exile , serving him and Sita endlessly. He also played a pivotal role in the war and killed Meghanada . Lakshmana is worshipped in Hinduism, at various places in India , alongside Rama and Sita . [ 5 ] Etymology [ edit ] The name Lakshmana is of Sanskrit origin, which means 'the one endowed with auspicious signs'. He bears the epithets of Saumitra ( Sanskrit :  , lit. 'son of Sumitra', IAST : Saumitra ) and Ramanuja ( Sanskrit :  , lit. 'younger brother of Rama', IAST : Rmnuja ). [ 6 ] Legend [ edit ] Birth and early life [ edit ] Birth of the four sons of Dasharatha King Dasharatha of Ayodhya had three wives: Kausalya , Kaikeyi , and Sumitra . He performed a yajna - Ashwamedha yajna to beget sons and as a result, his queens became pregnant. [ 7 ] Lakshmana and his brother Shatrughna were born to Sumitra, while Rama and Bharata were born to Kausalya and Kaikeyi respectively. [ 8 ] In the Puranas , Lakshmana is described as an incarnation of Shesha , [ 9 ] the multiple-headed naga (serpent) upon whom rests the preserver deity Vishnu , whose avatar Rama is considered to be. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] When sage Vishvamitra asked Rama to kill the demons in the forest, Lakshmana accompanied them and went to Mithila with them. Vishvamitra gives them the knowledge of the Devastras or celestial weaponry [bala and ati bala], trains them in advanced religion and guides them to kill powerful demons like Tataka , Maricha and Subahu . [ 12 ] Marriage to Urmila [ edit ] The marriage ceremony of Lakshmana and Urmila. Painting at Ramasamy Temple at Kumbakonam After Rama won the svayamvara of Sita , their marriage was fixed. King Dasharatha arrived in Mithila for his son's wedding and noticed that Lakshmana had feelings for Urmila , but according to tradition, Bharata and Mandavi were to marry first. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] King Dasharatha then arranged for Bharata to marry Mandavi and Shatrughna to marry Shrutakirti , allowing Lakshmana to marry Urmila. Ultimately, all four sisters married the four brothers, strengthening the alliance between the two kingdoms. [ 15 ] The wedding ceremony was conducted under the guidance of Shatananda . During the homeward journey to Ayodhya, another avatar of Vishnu , Parashurama , challenged Rama to combat, on the condition that he was able to string the bow of Vishnu, Sharanga . When Rama obliged him with success, Parashurama acknowledged the former to be a form of Vishnu and departed to perform penance at the mountain Mahendra . [ 16 ] The wedding entourage then reached Ayodhya, entering the city amid great fanfare. [ 17 ] According to Vishwamitra , Urmila and Lakshmana equals each other in ""grace and heritage"". [ 18 ] Urmila and Lakshmana had two sons named Angada and Chandraketu . Urmila is described as being as dedicated to Sita as he was to Rama. [ 19 ] Exile and war [ edit ] Main article: Exile of Rama Lakshmana is stricken by the magic arrows of Indrajita a Powerful warrior and Son of Ravana Lakshmana served Rama and Sita reverently during the exile. In Panchavati, Lakshmana also built a hut for Rama and Sita to live in. Lakshmana cut off Ravana 's sister Surpanakha 's nose in anger when she tried to seduce Rama and insulted Sita. He played an important role in the war with Ravana and slew Ravana's sons Indrajita (Meghanada) and Atikaya . [ 20 ] On the first night of exile, when Rama and Sita were sleeping, the deity Nidra appeared before Lakshmana and he requested her to offer him the boon of not sleeping for the fourteen years. [ 21 ] The goddess asked him that she could grant his wish, but someone else would have to take his place asleep. Lakshmana asked the goddess to enquire his wife Urmila regarding this, who happily accepted the task. Urmila slept continuously for the fourteen years of exile, to complete the sleep of her and her husband's share. Urmila is notable for this unparalleled sacrifice, which is called Urmila Nidra. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Rama in the exile, with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana When Sita asked Rama to fetch a magical golden deer for her, Rama asked Lakshmana to stand guard as he sensed danger and evil. The golden deer was the demon Maricha , who distracted Rama. When Rama killed Maricha, he cried out in Rama's voice for help. Although Lakshmana knew that Rama was invincible and beyond any danger, Sita panicked and frantically ordered Lakshmana to go to Rama's aid immediately. Unable to disobey Sita, Lakshmana drew a perimeter line ( Lakshmana Rekha ), which Sita must not cross and went in search of Rama. Sita, however, out of compulsion of religious duty and compassion for Ravana, who was disguised as a poor Brahmin , crossed the line to give him alms, following which she was abducted. [ 24 ] Through their search for Sita, Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes, and an adherent of Sugriva. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother Vali, thus regaining the kingdom of Kikindha, in exchange for helping Rma to recover Sita. However, Sugriva soon forgets his promise and this enrage Lakshmana, who was ready to destroy the ape citadel. [ 25 ] Lakshmana fights Indrajit (also known as Meghanada) during the war During the war between Rama and Ravana , Meghanada hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana and he is mortally wounded. So Hanumana assumes his gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching mountain, Hanuman is unable to identify the herb, sanjeevani, that will cure Lakshmana and so he decides to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. [ 26 ] Post his recovery, Lakshmana killed Meghanada and Atikaya , who were the sons of Ravana. [ 27 ] Post exile [ edit ] After the end of the Lanka war, Rama was crowned King of Kosala, and Bharata became the crown prince. Rama had offered to make Lakshmana the crown prince, but he refused, saying Bharata was elder to him and more deserving of the title. Rama, hearing this, was very pleased and said ""O Lakshmana, in this birth, you served me so well and did your duties as a younger brother, so I will do the same in my next birth as your younger brother"". Thus, in the next birth, Rama became Krishna and Lakshmana became Balarama, Krishna's elder brother. [ 28 ] Goddess Nidra had told Lakshman that he would have to go to sleep as soon as the exile ends, so that Urmila could awake. After the exile, Lakshaman went to sleep and Urmila saw the coronation of Rama. ""My brother, I have waited for this grand moment for years and just when I was about to witness my Lord Ram being crowned king, the goddess of sleep, Nidra, reminds me of our agreement and demands that I submit to her this very moment and go to sleep and let Urmila awaken."" [ 29 ]  The Princess Who Slept For 14 Years Lakshmana was the one who left Sita in the forests near sage Valmiki 's ashram after she expressed her desire to leave the kingdom. Lakshmana remained loyal to his brother and fought against Rama's sons Lava and Kusha later on. [ 30 ] According to the Uttara Kanda , Lakshmana had ruled over Karupada with Urmila as the queen; which was inherited by his elder son, Angada; whilst Lakshmana's younger son, Chandraketu had inherited Mallya , with its capital Chandrakanti being commissioned by Rama. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Renunciation of life [ edit ] Sage Durvasa appeared at Rama's doorstep, and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demanded an audience with Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama . Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential, and anyone who entered the room was to be relieved of their life. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshmana with the duty of guarding his door. When Durvasa made his demand, Lakshmana politely refused. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshmana did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. [ 33 ] Lakshmana, in a dilemma, decided it would be better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Durvasa cursed him that he should go to heaven alive. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. In order to fulfil his brother's promise, Lakshmana went to the banks of the river Sarayu , resolved on giving up the world by drowning himself in the Sarayu. From there, Indra removed Lakshmana from the water and took him alive to heaven. [ 34 ] Belief and assessment [ edit ] Rama is often worshiped with Lakshmana (left) and Sita on his sides; Kalaram Temple , Nashik Lakshmana has been described in the Ramayana , as a man with unwavering loyalty, love and commitment to his elder brother, through times of joy and adversity alike. He was also noted for being an obedient son, both to his parents and to his sister-in-law. [ 35 ] Bandhavgarh Fort in Madhya Pradesh ( bandhav as brother, garh as fort) was said to have been given by Rama to his brother Lakshmana to keep a watch on Lanka . [ 36 ] Military officers given the rank equivalent of admirals in navies in the Malay Archipelago, including Malaysia and Indonesia , are titled ""Lakshmana"" ( Jawi script :  ) after the figure. There are five ranks with his name, under General/flag officers. [ 37 ] Lakshamana Parshuram Conversation [ edit ] The Lakshmana-Parashurama dialogue in the Bal Kand of the Ramayana is one of the most famous and profound exchanges in Hindu scriptures. This interaction is not only a story but also a medium for imparting deep philosophical, religious, and social teachings. The dialogue involves three prominent characters  Lord Rama, Lakshmana, and Parashurama, each embodying unique virtues and qualities. [ 38 ] The confrontation begins after Lord Rama breaks Lord Shivas bow at Sita's Swayamvara. Parashurama, who holds a deep connection with Lord Shiva and his bow, becomes enraged. His anger is fueled not just by the bows breaking, but also by his own sense of pride and superiority in warfare. In this moment, Lord Rama confronts Parashurama with great wisdom, leading to the insightful dialogue that unfolds. Expansion of the Dialogue [ edit ] Source: [ 39 ] Upon hearing of the broken bow, Parashurama storms into King Janaks court in a rage. His anger strikes fear into the hearts of the assembled kings. Demanding the guilty party, he accuses the person who broke Shivas bow of being his enemy. Lakshmana, without hesitation, mocks Parashurama's anger, pointing out the absurdity of getting so upset over an old bow. Parashuramas response is full of pride, recounting his past battles and his self-proclaimed superiority over the Kshatriyas. Lakshmana continues to taunt Parashurama, claiming that all bows are the same and that breaking an old one is not such a great offense. The conversation escalates as Parashurama, enraged by Lakshmanas insolence, declares that his axe can destroy anyone who stands in his way. Lakshmana, ever fearless, continues to challenge Parashurama, saying that true bravery is shown through actions, not words. As Parashurama raises his axe in anger, Lakshmana dismisses it as a mere show of force. The sages pride, however, is not easily quelled, and he declares that he is sparing Lakshmanas life only out of respect for Vishwamitras request. The exchange reaches a turning point when Lord Rama steps in, calming the situation with his characteristic wisdom. He reminds Parashurama of his own virtuous nature and urges him to show mercy to the young Lakshmana. Rama humbly offers to take the blame for the incident, requesting Parashurama to forgive Lakshmana. In other versions [ edit ] Jain version [ edit ] Main articles: Rama in Jainism and alkpurua Rama and Lakshmana are the eighth set of Baladeva and Vasudeva according to the Jain universal history Lakshmana is referred to as Vasudeva in the Jain Ramayana. According to the Jain Ramayana, it was Lakshmana who killed Ravana , not Rama . [ 40 ] According to Jain storytelling, Lakshmana had around sixteen thousand wives in which Prithvisundari was his principle consort (in the Hindu epic, he had only one wife Urmila ). [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Gond version [ edit ] Lakshmana is the main protagonist in the Gond Ramayani . In this version, that is set post the Lanka war, Lakshmana goes through agnipravesham and not Sita. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Mahaviracharita [ edit ] The Sanskrit play Mahaviracharita by Bhavabhuti is based on the early life of Rama. According to the play, Vishwamitra invites Janaka to attend his sacrifice, but he sends his brother Kushadhvaja and daughters Sita and Urmila, as his delegates. This is the place, where Laxman and Urmila meet for the first time. By the end of the act, Kushadhvaja and Vishwamitra decide to marry Sita and Urmila to Rama and Lakshamana. [ 45 ] Temples and worship [ edit ] Although Lakshmana is worshipped with Rama in Rama temples, there are some temples dedicated him, where he is worshipped alongside his wife, Urmila. [ 46 ] Thirumoozhikkulam Lakshmana Perumal Temple , where Lakshmana is the main deity In Bharatpur district of Rajasthan , there is a temple dedicated to Lakshmana and Urmila.

[ 1 ] History Egyptian hieroglyph ""n"" Phoenician Mem Western Greek Mu Etruscan M Latin M The letter M is derived from the Phoenician Mem via the Greek Mu (, ). Semitic Mem is most likely derived from a "" Proto-Sinaitic ""  ( Bronze Age ) adoption of the ""water"" ideogram in Egyptian writing . The Egyptian sign had the acrophonic value /n/ , from the Egyptian word for ""water"", nt ; the adoption as the Semitic letter for /m/ was presumably also on acrophonic grounds, from the Semitic word for ""water"", m(y)- . [ 2 ] Use in writing systems Pronunciation of m by language Orthography Phonemes Standard Chinese ( Pinyin ) / m / English / m / , silent French / m / German / m / Portuguese / m / , silent Spanish / m / Turkish / m / English In English , m represents the voiced bilabial nasal /m/ . The Oxford English Dictionary (first edition) says that m is sometimes a vowel , such as in words like spasm and in the suffix -ism . In modern terminology, this is described as a syllabic consonant (IPA: /m/ ). M is the fourteenth most frequently used letter in the English language. Other languages The letter m represents the voiced bilabial nasal /m/ in the orthography of Latin as well as in those of many modern languages . In Washo , lower-case m represents a voiced bilabial nasal /m/ , while upper-case M represents a voiceless bilabial nasal /m/ . Other systems In the International Phonetic Alphabet , m represents the voiced bilabial nasal /m/ . Other uses Main article: M (disambiguation) Styled letter M in the coat of arms of Miehikkl The Roman numeral M represents the number 1000 , though it was not used in Roman times . There is, however, scant evidence that the letter was later introduced in the early centuries A.D. by the Romans. [ 3 ] Unit prefix M (mega), meaning one million times, and m (milli) meaning one-thousandth. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] m is the standard abbreviation for metre (or meter) in the International System of Units (SI). [ 4 ] However, m is also used as an abbreviation for mile . [ 5 ] M is used as the unit abbreviation for molarity . [ 4 ] With money amounts, m or M is ambiguous.  In the finance industry, [ 6 ] m or M means 1,000.  In this context, five million dollars is written 5mm or 5MM.  Outside of finance, some people use M like the metric system "" mega- "" to mean one million and write 5M. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] M often represents male or masculine, especially in conjunction with F for female or feminine. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In typography, an em dash is a punctuation symbol whose width is similar to that of a capital letter M. M is used as a logo by many rapid transit systems, standing for ""Metro"" (or equivalents in other languages.)

Reprise Universal Vertigo Phonogram Spitfire Sanctuary Spinoffs Heaven  Hell Last in Line Dio Disciples Spinoff of Black Sabbath Rainbow Past members See below Website www.ronniejamesdio.com Dio was an American heavy metal band formed in 1982 and led by vocalist Ronnie James Dio . Dio left Black Sabbath with intentions to form a new band with fellow former Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice . [ 1 ] The name Dio was chosen because it made sense from a commercial standpoint, [ citation needed ] as the name was already well known at that time. The band released ten studio albums and had numerous lineup changes over the years, with Dio himself being the only constant member. Guitarists included Vivian Campbell , Craig Goldy , Doug Aldrich , Warren DeMartini , [ 2 ] Tracy G , Jake E. Lee and Rowan Robertson . The band dissolved in 2010 when Ronnie James Dio died of stomach cancer at the age of 67. R. J. Dio has sold over 50 million records worldwide. [ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] Origins and Holy Diver (19821983) [ edit ] In 1982, disagreements originating over the mixing of Black Sabbath's Live Evil album resulted in the departure of Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice from the band. [ 4 ] Wanting to continue together as a band, the two formed Dio in October 1982 in the United States with guitarist Jake E. Lee and bassist Jimmy Bain . About a month after the bands formation, Lee was replaced by Vivian Campbell . The following May, the band released their debut album, Holy Diver , which featured two hit singles  "" Rainbow in the Dark "" and "" Holy Diver ""  that gained popularity, in part from MTV . Dio and Bain played keyboards in the studio, but keyboardist Claude Schnell was recruited for live shows in 1983 prior to the Holy Diver tour. Schnell played to the side of the stage on the first two tours before coming out front in 1985. [ 5 ] Dio had this to say of the band's origins: It was a good time to be in that band. It was perfect for us. Everything just fell into place. The ethic in rehearsal was amazing. The effort in the recording was just as good. Everybody wanted it to be great. We really believed in what we were doing and couldn't wait to get that product out and have people hear it. [ 6 ] The Last in Line to Dream Evil (19841989) [ edit ] Now a quintet with Schnell on keyboards, the band released their second studio album, The Last in Line , on July 2, 1984. It was followed by their third album, Sacred Heart , which was released on August 13, 1985. In 1985, Dio, Campbell and Bain also wrote the song ""Stars"" for the Hear 'n Aid project, with many other heavy metal luminaries of the time contributing. Campbell became unhappy working with Dio, [ 7 ] and the rift between them culminated in Campbell being fired from Dio's band. [ 8 ] Campbell was subsequently invited to join Whitesnake in 1987. [ 9 ] Several songs were recorded live during the Sacred Heart tour for the 1986 Intermission EP with Campbell still on guitar, however the EP also contained the studio track ""Time To Burn"", [ 10 ] which served to introduce fans to Craig Goldy as the new guitarist. On July 21, 1987, their fourth album Dream Evil was released. After Dream Evil , Goldy, wanting to pursue solo projects, left the band. [ 11 ] In June 1989, 18-year-old Rowan Robertson was announced as Goldy's successor but further changes were to follow, with Schnell, Bain and Appice leaving the band. Changes (19901999) [ edit ] Schnell, Bain, and Appice were replaced, respectively, with Jens Johansson , Teddy Cook, and former AC/DC drummer Simon Wright .  The new band released the album Lock Up the Wolves in the spring of 1990. During the tour, Dio had a chance meeting with former Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler which led to that band's short-lived reunion, producing one album, Dehumanizer . After this, Dio reassembled Dio once again, retaining only Appice on the drums. By early 1993, guitarist Tracy G , keyboardist Scott Warren of Warrant and bassist Jeff Pilson of Dokken had all joined. During this era, the band abandoned fantasy themed songs and focused on modern issues. [ 12 ] As a result, some fans regard the albums made during this period1993's Strange Highways , 1996's Angry Machines and the live album Inferno: Last in Live as the worst in Dio's catalogue, while others view them positively as a step away from the outdated sound of the 1980s. With disappointing record sales for Angry Machines , management wanted the band to go back to their earlier style prompting the departure of Tracy G [ 13 ] to be replaced by the returning Craig Goldy. In addition, Appice left Dio once again. Comeback (20002004) [ edit ] Dio performing in Paris, 2002 Craig Goldy's return facilitated the release of Dio's eighth studio album in 2000, Magica , which was regarded by many as the band's ""comeback album"" and reached No. 13 on the Billboard independent charts. It featured not only the return of Goldy but also of Simon Wright and Jimmy Bain, although on the European leg of the tour Chuck Garric played bass. Scott Warren remained in the band and performed live, although Dio and Bain handled all of the keyboard and synth on Magica . A concept album, Magica featured a return to the band's older, more successful sound, while increased use of keyboards gave it a more modern feel. [ 14 ] During the following tour, however, tensions rose between Goldy on the one hand and Bain and Dio on the other, as Goldy was dealing with family obligations. Goldy left the band in January 2002 and was replaced with Doug Aldrich , who Bain had met while recording a tribute album for Metallica . Because of his late arrival, Aldrich did not contribute much to Dio's ninth work, Killing the Dragon , which was written primarily by Dio and Bain. Killing The Dragon was released in 2002 through Spitfire Records and was well received in the metal community, making the Billboard top 200 . Aldrich would stay in the band until April of the following year, when he, like Campbell before him, joined Whitesnake , prompting Goldy's return. Soon afterward, Bain left the band. [ 15 ] Master of the Moon and Split (20042010) [ edit ] Dio released their tenth studio album, Master of the Moon on August 30, 2004 in Europe through SPV Records and on September 7, 2004 in the United States through Sanctuary Records . The album features multi-instrumentalist Jeff Pilson (formerly of Dokken ) on bass duties; however, because of prior obligations with Foreigner , he was only available for the recording sessions, and so was replaced by Rudy Sarzo (formerly of Ozzy Osbourne , Quiet Riot , Whitesnake , Blue yster Cult among others) on the tour. 2005 saw the release of the Dio live album Evil or Divine  Live in New York City , which featured the same show that was released on DVD in 2003. Dio toured South America , Japan , Europe , and Russia in 2005.  Their autumn tour was titled ""An Evening With Dio"" and featured a regular set, and then a second set of the band playing Holy Diver in its entirety. A DVD of the tour was filmed in London. The audio of this performance, a double CD named Holy Diver  Live was released in April 2006. In 2007, it was announced that Black Sabbath would reunite with Dio and go under the name Heaven  Hell . The band released The Devil You Know in 2009. Dio's involvement with Heaven  Hell delayed the recording of what was to be the follow-up to Master of the Moon , Magica II . [ 16 ] The three-year hiatus was briefly interrupted for a 10 concert European mini-tour in May/June 2008, and was scheduled to be interrupted again in November/December 2009 with 22 concerts starting in the UK and ending in Germany. [ 17 ] Doug Aldrich was to have filled in for Craig Goldy on guitar on these dates, who had other obligations. Dio intended to release a new single, entitled ""Electra"", to coincide with the tour. This would have been their first studio material in 5 years. The band also intended to record an album or two in 2010. [ 18 ] On November 18, 2009, the European tour was cancelled due to Dio's hospitalization. He had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, and was undergoing treatment. His manager and wife Wendy Dio thanked well-wishers and said ""After he kills this dragon, Ronnie will be back on stage, where he belongs, doing what he loves best, performing for his fans."" [ 19 ] On February 19, 2010, it was announced on Dio's official website that he would release a box set, entitled the Tournado Box Set , for limited purchase. The set includes the Killing the Dragon CD, Evil or Divine DVD ( PAL format only), DVD bonus material, interviews, photo gallery, never-before-seen behind the scenes footage, promo video for the Killing the Dragon track ""Push"", exclusive Dio cards, and the bonus CD single "" Electra "" (which is the last song the band recorded), from the unfinished albums Magica II  Magica III . [ 20 ] Death of Ronnie James Dio [ edit ] Dio died on May 16, 2010, of stomach cancer at the Texas Medical Center in Houston , Texas, at the age of 67. On November 9, 2010, a posthumous live album was released. Titled Dio at Donington UK: Live 1983  1987 , it features Dio's 1983 and 1987 appearances at the Monsters of Rock festival and showcases several songs from the Dio era of both Rainbow and Black Sabbath , in addition to songs from Dio's own catalogue. [ 21 ] When being interviewed by Classic Rock Magazine from the UK, Dio guitarist Craig Goldy stated ""We were working on tracks for a new Dio album just before Ronnie died in May. And we did almost finish one song. Wendy [Dio, Ronnie's widow/manager] has been talking about reissuing [DIO's] 'Magica' album (originally released in 2000) with bonus tracks, including this one."" Goldy goes on to say of the lyrics, that they were written by Dio when he was fighting cancer, and are ""very emotional"" and ""hard to listen to without a lump at the back of your throat"". [ 22 ] On March 18, it was announced that the surviving members of the final line-up of Dio would embark on a project with former Judas Priest front man Tim ""Ripper"" Owens under the moniker DIO Disciples. The project has been touring extensively since 2011. In May 2012, former Dio guitarist Vivian Campbell , despite his long established feud with Dio, announced his intent to reunite the original Dio band for a potential series of shows. This would include himself, drummer Vinny Appice, bassist Jimmy Bain, and keyboardist Claude Schnell. This announced line-up would feature former Lynch Mob vocalist and The Offspring touring member Andrew Freeman stepping in for Dio. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] and would perform under the name Last in Line . [ 25 ] Murray [ edit ] Murray is the demonic -looking mascot of Dio who appears on several of Dio's album covers , including Holy Diver , The Last in Line and Dream Evil , as well as on some of their singles and compilation albums . He was also featured in the sets for live shows. Holy Diver [ edit ] Dio's first studio album , Holy Diver , from 1983, was the first to feature Murray on its cover. Murray appears to be a demon torturing a cleric , but Ronnie James Dio said that it is not necessarily clear which one is the monster and which one is the priest. [ 26 ] The Last in Line [ edit ] Murray is also featured on Dio's second studio album, The Last in Line . On this cover, resurrected souls emerge from their graves on Judgment Day to find a gigantic Murray staring at them from the far horizon. Dream Evil [ edit ] Murray is not featured on Dio's third studio album, Sacred Heart , but is, for the last time in his original form, featured on the cover of Dream Evil . He is shown in the window of a bedroom with a child sleeping in a bed, while being haunted by several different spooky creatures. Murray's story is printed in the Dream Evil Tour book. The cover art of Dream Evil is a reference to one of the tracks on the album, ""Faces in the Window"" (the entire album's concept is fears and superstitions about the night and darkness ). Legacy [ edit ] Comedy rock duo Tenacious D released a song on their first album entitled ""Dio"", written as a tribute to Dio, which mocked him somewhat for being too old and stated that Tenacious D were going to take over his position as masters of heavy metal. [ 27 ] Before playing the song live, Jack Black would typically speak about how Dio's tenure in Black Sabbath served as his inspiration to get into heavy metal. The duo appeared in the music video for Dio's song ""Push"", and he in turn appeared and sang in Tenacious D's comedy movie The Pick of Destiny . [ 28 ] The Dio patch on the denim jacket worn by Eddie Munson (played by Joe Quinn) in a season of the Netflix show Stranger Things is made using a t-shirt from Ronnie James Dio's personal estate. The shows costume designer, Amy Parris, in a QA posted on the Netflix website said, He's (Munson) a fan of wizard metal, he's a fan of Dio. He's a fan of Metallica. Actually, Dio was a popular band in the '80s, and we reached out to the estate. His wife is in charge of his estate and offered to send us vintage T-shirts, which was such a dream."" [ 29 ] The 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System video game Holy Diver was named after the band's song of the same title and incorporates the members of the band as its protagonists, despite not being licensed from the band. The character Dio Brando , the main antagonist of the manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is named after the band. This has two meanings, as both a reference to the band and to the Italian for ""God"", referencing the character's high self-esteem.

At the Governors request, the Legislature appropriated an additional 10.5 million to meet the states commitment to homeowners in need, following expansion of the program in 2024. ""We know more than 4,600 additional families utilized this program last year, reflecting how important delivering relief to those most impacted by increased assessments has become,"" Governor Gordon said. The property tax refund program assists eligible Wyoming homeowners who are struggling to pay their property taxes, which can often be a significant financial burden, particularly for those with fixed or limited incomes. In 2023, the program helped 13,485 Wyoming families, with more than 14,265,960 million in refunds distributed, with the average refund being approximately 1,058.23. Homeowners can apply for a refund of up to one-half of the median residential property tax amount or 75 percent of their 2024 property tax bill, whichever is less. Eligibility is limited to homeowners: -	whose gross household income is equal to or less than 145 percent of the median household income for their county of residence, or the statewide median, whichever is greater; -	have been Wyoming resident for at least five years,-	occupy the residence at least nine months of the tax year; have total assets less than 163,019 per adult household member, excluding the value of your home, one vehicle per adult member of the household and any retirement accounts, life insurance or medical saving accounts from that calculation.  If the homeowners 2024 property tax paid exceeds 10 of your total household income, the asset requirement is waived. Brenda Henson, Director of the Department of Revenue, stated all taxpayers who applied for refunds last year will receive an application in the mail in mid-April. Taxpayers may also apply online at wptrs.wyo.gov beginning April 2, 2025. In addition, applications are available from local County Treasurer's offices across the state. All applications must be properly completed and filed with the Department of Revenue or the County Treasurer's office no later than June 2, 2025. Before applying for the refund, individuals must pay their 2024 taxes in full.

Treasury Department suspends enforcement of Corporate Transparency Act against U.S. citizens and domestic reporting companies (posted 3/3/2025) Pinedale Online! On March 2, 2025, the US Treasury Department announced that U.S. citizens and businesses will not be subject to fines or penalties for failing to file beneficial ownership information (BOI) reports after new reporting deadlines are set. This follows an announcement by Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that it would announce new BOI reporting deadlines no later than March 21, 2025 to extend the current March 21 BOI reporting deadline. Reports were originally due by the start of 2025. However, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) pushed that date to January 13, 2025. A subsequent court injunction nullified this deadline. FinCEN later said it would announce new BOI reporting deadlines no later than March 21, 2025. Willful violations had been punishable by a fine of 606 a day, up to 10,000, and two years in prison with similarly serious penalties for unauthorized disclosure. The lawsuits and rulings have created great confusion and uncertainty for small businesses trying to understand what they need to do regarding complying with the Department of Treasurys regulations. Below is the text of the press release posted on the Department of Treasury website: ""The Treasury Department is announcing today (Sunday, March 2, 2025) that, with respect to the Corporate Transparency Act, not only will it not enforce any penalties or fines associated with the beneficial ownership information reporting rule under the existing regulatory deadlines, but it will further not enforce any penalties or fines against U.S. citizens or domestic reporting companies or their beneficial owners after the forthcoming rule changes take effect either. The Treasury Department will further be issuing a proposed rulemaking that will narrow the scope of the rule to foreign reporting companies only. Treasury takes this step in the interest of supporting hard-working American taxpayers and small businesses and ensuring that the rule is appropriately tailored to advance the public interest."" ""This is a victory for common sense,"" said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.  ""Todays action is part of President Trumps bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.""

Game and Fish wildlife managers are moving forward with this designation process, in accordance with Wyomings Migration Corridor Executive Order. The meetings will allow the public to ask questions, provide feedback, and discuss the identified migration corridor as well as the biological risk and opportunity assessment. ""Wyomings open landscapes provide key migration paths for species such as mule deer and antelope,"" said Game and Fish Deputy Director of External Affairs Doug Brimeyer. ""Evaluating these vital movement areas is an important measure towards conserving habitats and maintaining healthy big game populations in the state. Collaboration with landowners, agency managers and the public is an essential part of this process."" Three public meetings will be held to gather input at the following locations: Wednesday, April 9, 2025: Green River, 6:00PM, WWCC, John Wesley Powell Room, 1 College Way, Room 206 Thursday, April 10, 2025: Jackson , 3:00PM, Wyoming Game and Fish Regional Office, 420 N. Cache Tuesday, April 15, 2025: Pinedale, 6:00PM, Lovatt Room, Pinedale Library The steps toward designating a migration corridor are outlined in the Wyoming Mule Deer and Antelope Migration Corridor Protection Executive Order. The Commission voted to identify the corridor and move forward in the designation process at its March 2024 meeting in Pinedale. After considering the identified corridor, the biological risk assessment and public comment, the Game and Fish Commission will vote on whether to recommend to Governor Gordon that the identified corridor be formally designated at their July 2025 meeting in Evanston. The deadline to submit comments is 5 p.m. May 2, 2025. Written comments will be presented to the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission before the July 2025 meeting. Comments can be submitted through our online form or by mail to the Pinedale Regional Game and Fish Office, PO Box 850, Pinedale, WY 82941.

Former Game and Fish Director nominated as Director of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (posted 2/15/2025) Nesvik worked as a Game Warden in Pinedale Wyoming Game  Fish CHEYENNE, WYOMING  Former Wyoming Game and Fish Department Director Brian Nesvik was nominated by the Trump administration to be the next U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director. The nomination was announced Feb. 12. ""Brian is an outstanding leader, and if he is appointed, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will be in good hands,"" current Wyoming Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce said. ""He has a proven track record of working to develop science-based policies and programs for wildlife management, and his expertise would greatly benefit the federal and state wildlife management agencies. I have no doubt that, if appointed, Brian will work collaboratively with all agencies and organizations throughout the country for the benefit of wildlife. He is the right person at the right time."" Nesvik retired from Game and Fish in 2024 after more than 29 years with the agency. He worked his way up the ranks, from a game warden in the Laramie and Pinedale areas, the title of Cody Regional Wildlife Supervisor in 2010, and Chief Game Warden and Wildlife Division Chief in 2011. Nesvik was appointed as Game and Fish Director by Gov. Matt Mead in 2019. During his tenure as director, Nesvik tackled issues such as grizzly management and aquatic invasive species, as well as the ongoing challenges in managing healthy mule deer populations. Nesvik served in the Wyoming Army National Guard for 35 years, and retired as a brigadier general in 2021. Current Chief Game Warden and Wildlife Division Chief Dan Smith said Nesvik's hands-on experience with Game and Fish will give him a realistic perspective as he works on national-level wildlife issues in Washington, D.C. ""Brians real-world experience with the challenges we face in wildlife conservation will be a tremendous benefit as we work with our federal counterparts,"" Smith said. ""I am optimistic that with his leadership, state agencies will be able to further strengthen their partnerships and common objectives in conservation efforts."" Nesvik will undergo a Senate hearing later this month in order to receive official confirmation. CWD found in new Wyoming hunt area (posted 2/15/2025) Wyoming Game and Fish Department PINEDALE, WYOMING  The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has confirmed the presence of chronic wasting disease in two adult female elk from Elk Hunt Area 87. The first elk was found dead in January, followed by the second in early February. Both elk were discovered at the Dell Creek feedground. Department personnel have investigated the sites, collected samples and removed the carcasses. Elk Hunt Area 87 is located in the Pinedale Region. It is bordered by two CWD-positive elk hunt areas: 84 and 92. This marks the first recorded cases of CWD in Hunt Area 87 and is the first detection of the disease within the Upper Green River Elk Herd. This is the second confirmed instance of elk testing positive at a feedground, following a previous detection of CWD at the Scab Creek feedground in December. ""It is unfortunate and concerning to find CWD on an elk feedground;"" said Wildlife Division Deputy Chief Justin Binfet. ""However, it was not unexpected given this disease continues to spread throughout the West. In anticipation of the spread of CWD to elk feedgrounds, the department created its Elk Feedground Management Plan, which will guide wildlife managers to work to minimize and mitigate CWD risks and look for long-term solutions to disease transmission on feedgrounds."" CWD is 100 percent fatal to infected deer, elk and moose. Continued monitoring of CWD over time is important to help Game and Fish understand the potential impacts of the disease, as well as evaluate future management actions. Department personnel will continue to closely monitor feedgrounds for elk showing signs of CWD. Game and Fish personnel from the Jackson and Pinedale regions are currently developing the first Feedground Management Action Plans (FMAPs) for the Jackson and Pinedale herds. This process aims to identify both long and short-term strategies to reduce the elk's reliance on feedgrounds and mitigate the risks of disease transmission. After completing the initial FMAP process for the Pinedale Herd, the Region will determine which herd to prioritize next. Please visit the Game and Fish website for more information on CWD testing, transmission and regulations on transportation and disposal of carcasses. Whooping Cough cases increasing in Wyoming (posted 2/11/2025) 19 confirmed cases reported so far in Wyoming Wyoming Department of Health With recently increased cases of pertussis (whooping cough) across the state, including a current outbreak in Sheridan County, the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) is encouraging awareness of the disease. At least 10 Sheridan County pertussis cases have been reported to WDH over the past couple of weeks with additional recent cases in Campbell, Johnson and Lincoln counties. ""That brings us to 18 reported cases so far this year and were only in the years second month,"" said Clay Van Houten, infectious disease epidemiology unit manager with WDH. Van Houten noted pertussis activity went up in 2024 significantly with 19 total confirmed cases. There were 0 reported pertussis cases in 2023 and 2 in 2022. Actual case numbers in any year are likely higher because many illnesses are not recognized as pertussis and others may not be reported. The department sent a December 2024 advisory to Wyoming healthcare providers noting increased pertussis activity. ""Any surge in pertussis activity is something we watch with concern because it can be so tough on infants,"" Van Houten said. More than half of infants less than 1 year of age who become ill with pertussis must be hospitalized; in some cases, it can be deadly. ""Thankfully, we have not seen hospitalizations involving Wyoming babies due to pertussis so far this year. Large outbreaks with infant deaths have happened in other states over the last couple of decades and we just dont want that to happen here,"" Van Houten said. Van Houten said the Tdap adolescent/adult pertussis booster vaccine is important for those who spend time with new infants such as parents, grandparents and other people who take care of them. ""If you are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about a Tdap vaccine, which can help protect infants,"" he said. ""Infants are most vulnerable and dont yet have the protection a pertussis vaccine can offer."" ""In addition to our focus on protecting babies, we recommend all residents stay up to date with their pertussis vaccines for themselves,"" Van Houten said. ""Those who still become ill with pertussis after vaccination are less likely to have a severe infection."" Pertussis typically begins with cold-like symptoms and perhaps a mild cough. Pertussis is often not suspected or diagnosed uneeks. Infants and children can cough violently and rapidly with a loud ""whooping"" sound. ""Pertussis is not always recognized because it has been less common in the United States over the last several decades due to immunizations slowing its spread overall,"" Van Houten said.

Graphics  courtesy Wyoming Game  Fish. Game and Fish conducts annual mule deer surveys (posted 1/4/2025) Wyoming Range and Sublette herds continue to recover Wyoming Game  Fish Each winter, Wyoming Game and Fish Department personnel conduct aerial surveys to assess mule deer populations. In late December, wildlife managers in the Jackson and Pinedale regions took to the sky to record classification data for the Wyoming Range and Sublette mule deer herds. Managers continue to evaluate mule deer recovery in the Wyoming Range and Sublette herds following the severe winter of 2022-23, which resulted in above-average mortality. The data collected from these surveys, along with data from ongoing research, provide valuable insight into population trends and assist managers with hunting season recommendations. Long-term research on mule deer in the Wyoming Range Herd, conducted in partnership with the Monteith Shop at the University of Wyoming, indicated mule deer entered this winter in very good body condition. The average body fat percentage of adult females captured during the fall of 2024 was 12.9, a slight decrease from the average during fall 2023 of 15.8, which was the highest recorded since the study began in 2013. Last summer, researchers captured fawns on the ground in the Wyoming Range. The average birth mass of newborn fawns was 7.7 pounds, the largest measurement recorded since 2016, and nearly 1 pound larger than average birth mass across all previous years. Weather patterns such as drought and extreme winters affect the quality and quantity of forage available to mule deer. Forage production and availability have significant impacts on the body condition of deer heading into winter. ""High precipitation zones that approach 30 inches or more on Wyoming Range mule deer summer ranges allow a diversity of plants to grow, which enables doe deer to produce and care for viable and healthy fawns before they migrate to winter ranges,"" said Gary Fralick, Game and Fish south Jackson wildlife biologist. Additionally, the relatively mild and snow-free winter conditions over the last two years have resulted in high over-winter survival. ""Deer are able to disperse over the entire winter range because of the low snow accumulations, and therefore maximize the use of forage at elevations that approach 9,000 feet on winter ranges,"" Fralick said. The high fawn crop and elevated survival rates heading into this winter were evident in the December aerial classification surveys. During these annual surveys, biologists and game wardens fly over winter ranges from a helicopter and tally the number of observed fawns, does, yearling bucks and adult bucks. The population data for the Wyoming Range Herd includes hunt areas 134, 135 and 143-145. The December flight survey resulted in 4,902 mule deer counted and indicated a considerable increase in fawn ratios at 83 fawns for every 100 does, up from 34 fawns for every 100 does surveyed in 2023. These high fawn ratios are consistent with findings from the long-term research data that showed high survival of marked fawns last summer. The overall buck ratio was up with 28 bucks for every 100 does. This is approaching the 30-45 buck-to-doe ratio objective. Yearling buck ratios increased to nine bucks for every 100 does, while adult buck ratios remained unchanged at 19 bucks for every 100 does. While the ratio of adult bucks remained stable, the increase in yearling bucks contributed to a rise in overall buck ratios for the herd. In the Sublette Deer Herd, which includes winter ranges in hunt areas 130, 131, 138, 139, 140 and 142, biologists recorded 7,645 mule deer during the December flight survey. Similar to the Wyoming Range deer survey, there was a notable increase in the number of fawns observed. The classification survey indicated a fawn ratio of 76 fawns for every 100 does  the highest ratio observed since 2006. The overall buck-to-doe ratio remains stable at 34 bucks for every 100 does, identical to the findings from 2023. The ratio of yearling bucks increased to 10 bucks for every 100 does, whereas the ratio of adult bucks decreased to 23 bucks for every 100 does. ""Both herds have demonstrated resilience in the past, quickly recovering from periods of high winter mortality. We witnessed this recovery in the mid-2000s and again from 2011-16 and 2017-22,"" Fralick said. ""During those times, the mild and open winter conditions led to high over-winter survival rates for mule deer and rapid recovery of the populations."" As the Wyoming Range and Sublette herds continue to recover, wildlife managers will assess mule deer hunting season structures. ""As these herds recover, our hunting seasons will be adjusted to maximize opportunities while still meeting herd unit objectives, such as maintaining appropriate buck ratios,"" said Dean Clause, Game and Fish wildlife biologist for the Pinedale Region.

The microwave is between 1 meter to 1 millimeter . The millimetre ( international spelling ; SI unit symbol mm ) or millimeter ( American spelling ) is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), equal to one thousandth of a metre , which is the SI base unit of length. Therefore, there are one thousand millimetres in a metre. There are ten millimetres in a centimetre. One millimetre is equal to 1000 micrometres or 1 000 000 nanometres . Since an inch is officially defined as exactly 25.4 millimetres, a millimetre is equal to exactly 5  127 ( 0.03937) of an inch. Definition [ edit ] Since 1983, the metre has been defined as ""the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of  1 / 299 792 458  of a second "". [ 1 ] A millimetre,  1 / 1000  of a metre, is therefore the distance travelled by light in  1 / 299 792 458 000  of a second. Informal terminology [ edit ] A common shortening of millimetre in spoken English is ""mil"".  This can cause confusion in the United States, where ""mil"" traditionally means a thousandth of an inch . Unicode symbols [ edit ] For the purposes of compatibility with Chinese , Japanese and Korean ( CJK ) characters, Unicode has SQUARE form symbols for: [ 2 ] millimetre - U339C  SQUARE MM square millimetre - U339F  SQUARE MM SQUARED cubic millimetre U33A3  SQUARE MM CUBED In Japanese typography, these square symbols are used for laying out unit symbols without distorting the grid layout of text characters. Measurement [ edit ] On a metric ruler, the smallest measurements are normally millimetres. [ 3 ] High-quality engineering rulers may be graduated in increments of 0.5 mm. Digital callipers are commonly capable of reading increments as small as 0.01 mm. [ 4 ] Microwaves with a frequency of 300 GHz have a wavelength of 1 mm. Using frequencies between 30 GHz and 300 GHz for data transmission, in contrast to the 300 MHz to 3 GHz normally used in mobile devices, has the potential to allow data transfer rates of 10 gigabits per second. [ 5 ] The smallest dimension the human eye can resolve is around 0.02 to 0.04 mm, approximately the width of a thin human hair . [ 6 ] A sheet of paper is typically between 0.07 mm and 0.18 mm thick, with ordinary printer paper or copy paper approximately 0.1 mm thick.

Adding (or subtracting) 0 to any number leaves that number unchanged; in mathematical terminology, 0 is the additive identity of the integers , rational numbers , real numbers , and complex numbers , as well as other algebraic structures . Multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, and consequently division by zero has no meaning in arithmetic . As a numerical digit , 0 plays a crucial role in decimal notation: it indicates that the power of ten corresponding to the place containing a 0 does not contribute to the total. For example, ""205"" in decimal means two hundreds, no tens, and five ones. The same principle applies in place-value notations that uses a base other than ten, such as binary and hexadecimal . The modern use of 0 in this manner derives from Indian mathematics that was transmitted to Europe via medieval Islamic mathematicians and popularized by Fibonacci . It was independently used by the Maya . Common names for the number 0 in English include zero , nought , naught ( / n  t / ), and nil . In contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter O , the number is sometimes pronounced as oh or o ( / o / ). Informal or slang terms for 0 include zilch and zip . Historically, ought , aught ( /  t / ), and cipher have also been used. Etymology Main articles: Names for the number 0 and Names for the number 0 in English The word zero came into the English language via French zro from the Italian zero , a contraction of the Venetian zevero form of Italian zefiro via afira or ifr . [ 1 ] In pre-Islamic time the word ifr (Arabic  ) had the meaning ""empty"". [ 2 ] Sifr evolved to mean zero when it was used to translate nya ( Sanskrit :  ) from India. [ 2 ] The first known English use of zero was in 1598. [ 3 ] The Italian mathematician Fibonacci ( c. 1170  c. 1250 ), who grew up in North Africa and is credited with introducing the decimal system to Europe, used the term zephyrum . This became zefiro in Italian, and was then contracted to zero in Venetian. The Italian word zefiro was already in existence (meaning ""west wind"" from Latin and Greek Zephyrus ) and may have influenced the spelling when transcribing Arabic ifr . [ 4 ] Modern usage Depending on the context, there may be different words used for the number zero, or the concept of zero. For the simple notion of lacking, the words "" nothing "" (although this is not accurate) and ""none"" are often used. The British English words ""nought"" or ""naught"" , and "" nil "" are also synonymous. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] It is often called ""oh"" in the context of reading out a string of digits, such as telephone numbers , street addresses , credit card numbers , military time , or years. For example, the area code 201 may be pronounced ""two oh one"", and the year 1907 is often pronounced ""nineteen oh seven"". The presence of other digits, indicating that the string contains only numbers, avoids confusion with the letter O. For this reason, systems that include strings with both letters and numbers (such as Canadian postal codes ) may exclude the use of the letter O. [ citation needed ] Slang words for zero include ""zip"", ""zilch"", ""nada"", and ""scratch"". [ 7 ] In the context of sports, ""nil"" is sometimes used, especially in British English . Several sports have specific words for a score of zero, such as "" love "" in tennis  from French l'uf , ""the egg""  and "" duck "" in cricket , a shortening of ""duck's egg"". ""Goose egg"" is another general slang term used for zero. [ 7 ] History Ancient Near East nfr heart with trachea beautiful, pleasant, good Ancient Egyptian numerals were of base 10 . [ 8 ] They used hieroglyphs for the digits and were not positional . In one papyrus written around 1770 BC , a scribe recorded daily incomes and expenditures for the pharaoh 's court, using the nfr hieroglyph to indicate cases where the amount of a foodstuff received was exactly equal to the amount disbursed. Egyptologist Alan Gardiner suggested that the nfr hieroglyph was being used as a symbol for zero. The same symbol was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids, and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line. [ 9 ] By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated base 60 positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating to as early as 700 BC ), the scribe Bl-bn-aplu used three hooks as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system . [ 10 ] By 300 BC , a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was repurposed as a placeholder. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The Babylonian positional numeral system differed from the later HinduArabic system in that it did not explicitly specify the magnitude of the leading sexagesimal digit, so that for example the lone digit 1 ( ) might represent any of 1, 60, 3600  60 2 , etc., similar to the significand of a floating-point number but without an explicit exponent, and so only distinguished implicitly from context. The zero-like placeholder mark was only ever used in between digits, but never alone or at the end of a number. [ 13 ] Pre-Columbian Americas Maya numeral zero The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar developed in south-central Mexico and Central America required the use of zero as a placeholder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. Many different glyphs, including the partial quatrefoil were used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the earliest of which (on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas ) has a date of 36 BC. [ a ] [ 14 ] Since the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland, [ 15 ] it is generally believed that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs . [ 16 ] Many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland, although the Olmec civilization ended by the 4th century BC , [ 17 ] several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates. [ 18 ] Although zero became an integral part of Maya numerals , with a different, empty tortoise -like "" shell shape "" used for many depictions of the ""zero"" numeral, it is assumed not to have influenced Old World numeral systems. [ citation needed ] Quipu , a knotted cord device, used in the Inca Empire and its predecessor societies in the Andean region to record accounting and other digital data, is encoded in a base ten positional system. Zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position. [ 19 ] Classical antiquity The ancient Greeks had no symbol for zero (, pronounced 'midn'), and did not use a digit placeholder for it. [ 20 ] According to mathematician Charles Seife , the ancient Greeks did begin to adopt the Babylonian placeholder zero for their work in astronomy after 500 BC, representing it with the lowercase Greek letter  (  : omicron ). However, after using the Babylonian placeholder zero for astronomical calculations they would typically convert the numbers back into Greek numerals . Greeks seemed to have a philosophical opposition to using zero as a number. [ 21 ] Other scholars give the Greek partial adoption of the Babylonian zero a later date, with neuroscientist Andreas Nieder giving a date of after 400 BC and mathematician Robert Kaplan dating it after the conquests of Alexander . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Greeks seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number. Some of them asked themselves, ""How can not being be?"", leading to philosophical and, by the medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the vacuum . The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero. [ 24 ] Example of the early Greek symbol for zero (lower right corner) from a 2nd-century papyrus By AD 150, Ptolemy , influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians , was using a symbol for zero (   ) [ 25 ] [ 26 ] in his work on mathematical astronomy called the Syntaxis Mathematica , also known as the Almagest . [ 27 ] This Hellenistic zero was perhaps the earliest documented use of a numeral representing zero in the Old World. [ 28 ] Ptolemy used it many times in his Almagest (VI.8) for the magnitude of solar and lunar eclipses . It represented the value of both digits and minutes of immersion at first and last contact. Digits varied continuously from 0 to 12 to 0 as the Moon passed over the Sun (a triangular pulse), where twelve digits was the angular diameter of the Sun. Minutes of immersion was tabulated from 0  0 to 31  20 to 0  0, where 0  0 used the symbol as a placeholder in two positions of his sexagesimal positional numeral system, [ b ] while the combination meant a zero angle. Minutes of immersion was also a continuous function  1 / 12  31  20  d(24d) (a triangular pulse with convex sides), where d was the digit function and 31  20 was the sum of the radii of the Sun's and Moon's discs. [ 29 ] Ptolemy's symbol was a placeholder as well as a number used by two continuous mathematical functions, one within another, so it meant zero, not none. Over time, Ptolemy's zero tended to increase in size and lose the overline , sometimes depicted as a large elongated 0-like omicron """" or as omicron with overline """" instead of a dot with overline. [ 30 ] The earliest use of zero in the calculation of the Julian Easter occurred before AD 311, at the first entry in a table of epacts as preserved in an Ethiopic document for the years 311 to 369, using a Ge'ez word for ""none"" (English translation is ""0"" elsewhere) alongside Ge'ez numerals (based on Greek numerals), which was translated from an equivalent table published by the Church of Alexandria in Medieval Greek . [ 31 ] This use was repeated in 525 in an equivalent table, that was translated via the Latin nulla (""none"") by Dionysius Exiguus , alongside Roman numerals . [ 32 ] When division produced zero as a remainder, nihil , meaning ""nothing"", was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval calculators of Easter . The initial ""N"" was used as a zero symbol in a table of Roman numerals by Bede or his colleaguesaround AD 725. [ 33 ] In most cultures , 0 was identified before the idea of negative things (i.e., quantities less than zero) was accepted. [ citation needed ] China This is a depiction of zero expressed in Chinese counting rods , based on the example provided by A History of Mathematics . An empty space is used to represent zero. [ 34 ] The Snz Sunjng , of unknown date but estimated to be dated from the 1st to 5th centuries AD , describe how the 4th century BC Chinese counting rods system enabled one to perform decimal calculations. As noted in the Xiahou Yang Suanjing (425468 AD), to multiply or divide a number by 10, 100, 1000, or 10000, all one needs to do, with rods on the counting board, is to move them forwards, or back, by 1, 2, 3, or 4 places. [ 35 ] The rods gave the decimal representation of a number, with an empty space denoting zero. [ 34 ] [ 36 ] The counting rod system is a positional notation system. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Zero was not treated as a number at that time, but as a ""vacant position"". [ 39 ] Qn Jisho 's 1247 Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections is the oldest surviving Chinese mathematical text using a round symbol  for zero. [ 40 ] The origin of this symbol is unknown; it may have been produced by modifying a square symbol. [ 41 ] Chinese authors had been familiar with the idea of negative numbers by the Han dynasty (2nd century AD) , as seen in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art . [ 42 ] India Pingala ( c. 3rd or 2nd century BC), [ 43 ] a Sanskrit prosody scholar, [ 44 ] used binary sequences , in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), to identify the possible valid Sanskrit meters , a notation similar to Morse code . [ 45 ] Pingala used the Sanskrit word nya explicitly to refer to zero. [ 43 ] Bakhshali manuscript, with the numeral ""zero"" represented by a black dot; its date is uncertain. [ 46 ] The concept of zero as a written digit in the decimal place value notation was developed in India . [ 47 ] A symbol for zero, a large dot likely to be the precursor of the still-current hollow symbol, is used throughout the Bakhshali manuscript , a practical manual on arithmetic for merchants. [ 48 ] In 2017, researchers at the Bodleian Library reported radiocarbon dating results for three samples from the manuscript, indicating that they came from three different centuries: from AD 224383, AD 680779, and AD 885993. It is not known how the birch bark fragments from different centuries forming the manuscript came to be packaged together. If the writing on the oldest birch bark fragments is as old as those fragments, it represents South Asia's oldest recorded use of a zero symbol. However, it is possible that the writing dates instead to the time period of the youngest fragments, AD 885993. The latter dating has been argued to be more consistent with the sophisticated use of zero within the document, as portions of it appear to show zero being employed as a number in its own right, rather than only as a positional placeholder. [ 46 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The Lokavibhga , a Jain text on cosmology surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit original, which is internally dated to AD 458 ( Saka era 380), uses a decimal place-value system , including a zero. In this text, nya (""void, empty"") is also used to refer to zero. [ 51 ] The Aryabhatiya ( c. 499), states sthnt sthna daagua syt ""from place to place each is ten times the preceding"". [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Rules governing the use of zero appeared in Brahmagupta 's Brahmasputha Siddhanta (7th century), which states the sum of zero with itself as zero, and incorrectly describes division by zero in the following way: [ 55 ] [ 56 ] A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero. Epigraphy Sambor Inscription The oldest, firmly dated use of zero as a decimal figure, found on the Sambor Inscription. The number ""605"" is written in Khmer numerals (top), referring to the year it was made: 605 Saka era (683 CE). The fragment, inscribed in Old Khmer , was once part of a temple doorway, and was found in Krati province , Cambodia . A black dot is used as a decimal placeholder in the Bakhshali manuscript , portions of which date from AD 224993. [ 46 ] There are numerous copper plate inscriptions, with the same small O in them, some of them possibly dated to the 6th century, but their date or authenticity may be open to doubt. [ 10 ] A stone tablet found in the ruins of a temple near Sambor on the Mekong , Krati Province , Cambodia , includes the inscription of ""605"" in Khmer numerals (a set of numeral glyphs for the HinduArabic numeral system ). The number is the year of the inscription in the Saka era , corresponding to a date of AD 683. [ 57 ] The first known use of special glyphs for the decimal digits that includes the indubitable appearance of a symbol for the digit zero, a small circle, appears on a stone inscription found at the Chaturbhuj Temple, Gwalior , in India, dated AD 876. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Middle Ages Transmission to Islamic culture See also: History of the HinduArabic numeral system The Arabic -language inheritance of science was largely Greek , [ 60 ] followed by Hindu influences. [ 61 ] In 773, at Al-Mansur 's behest, translations were made of many ancient treatises including Greek, Roman, Indian, and others. In AD 813, astronomical tables were prepared by a Persian mathematician, Muammad ibn Ms al-Khwrizm , using Hindu numerals; [ 61 ] and about 825, he published a book synthesizing Greek and Hindu knowledge and also contained his own contribution to mathematics including an explanation of the use of zero. [ 62 ] This book was later translated into Latin in the 12th century under the title Algoritmi de numero Indorum . This title means ""al-Khwarizmi on the Numerals of the Indians"". The word ""Algoritmi"" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name, and the word "" Algorithm "" or "" Algorism "" started to acquire a meaning of any arithmetic based on decimals. [ 61 ] Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khwarizmi , in 976, stated that if no number appears in the place of tens in a calculation, a little circle should be used ""to keep the rows"". This circle was called ifr . [ 63 ] Transmission to Europe The HinduArabic numeral system (base 10) reached Western Europe in the 11th century, via Al-Andalus , through Spanish Muslims , the Moors , together with knowledge of classical astronomy and instruments like the astrolabe . Gerbert of Aurillac is credited with reintroducing the lost teachings into Catholic Europe. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as ""Arabic numerals"". The Italian mathematician Fibonacci or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating: After my father's appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism , as well as the art of Pythagoras , I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus [ Modus Indorum ]. Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid 's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0 ... any number may be written. [ 64 ] From the 13th century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe where they were called algorismus after the Persian mathematician al-Khwrizm . One popular manual was written by Johannes de Sacrobosco in the early 1200s and was one of the earliest scientific books to be printed , in 1488. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] The practice of calculating on paper using HinduArabic numerals only gradually displaced calculation by abacus and recording with Roman numerals . [ 67 ] In the 16th century, HinduArabic numerals became the predominant numerals used in Europe. [ 65 ] Symbols and representations Main article: Symbols for zero Oslo airport train station, Platform 0 Today, the numerical digit 0 is usually written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. [ 68 ] Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character displays . [ 68 ] A slashed zero ( 0 / displaystyle 0!!!/ ) is often used to distinguish the number from the letter (mostly in computing, navigation and in the military, for example). The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as Andal Mono , and in some airline reservation systems. One variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made the  ""0"" character more squared at the edges, like a rectangle, and the ""O"" character more rounded. A further distinction is made in falsification-hindering typeface as used on German car number plates by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. In some systems either the letter O or the numeral 0, or both, are excluded from use, to avoid confusion. Mathematics See also: Null (mathematics) The concept of zero plays multiple roles in mathematics: as a digit, it is an important part of positional notation for representing numbers, while it also plays an important role as a number in its own right in many algebraic settings. As a digit Main article: Positional notation In positional number systems (such as the usual decimal notation for representing numbers), the digit 0 plays the role of a placeholder, indicating that certain powers of the base do not contribute. For example, the decimal number 205 is the sum of two hundreds and five ones, with the 0 digit indicating that no tens are added. The digit plays the same role in decimal fractions and in the decimal representation of other real numbers (indicating whether any tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc., are present) and in bases other than 10 (for example, in binary, where it indicates which powers of 2 are omitted). [ 69 ] Elementary algebra A number line from 3 to 3, with 0 in the middle The number 0 is the smallest nonnegative integer , and the largest nonpositive integer. The natural number following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. The number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number , [ 70 ] [ 71 ] but it is an integer , and hence a rational number and a real number . [ 72 ] All rational numbers are algebraic numbers , including 0. When the real numbers are extended to form the complex numbers , 0 becomes the origin of the complex plane. The number 0 can be regarded as neither positive nor negative [ 73 ] or, alternatively, both positive and negative [ 74 ] and is usually displayed as the central number in a number line . Zero is even [ 75 ] (that is, a multiple of 2), and is also an integer multiple of any other integer, rational, or real number. It is neither a prime number nor a composite number : it is not prime because prime numbers are greater than 1 by definition, and it is not composite because it cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller natural numbers. [ 76 ] (However, the singleton set 0 is a prime ideal in the ring of the integers.) The following are some basic rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number x , unless otherwise stated. Addition : x  0  0  x  x . That is, 0 is an identity element (or neutral element) with respect to addition. Subtraction : x  0  x and 0  x   x . Multiplication : x  0  0  x  0. Division :  0 / x   0, for nonzero x . But  x / 0  is undefined , because 0 has no multiplicative inverse (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule. [ 77 ] Exponentiation : x 0   x / x   1, except that the case x  0 is considered undefined in some contexts. For all positive real x , 0 x  0 . The expression  0 / 0  , which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form  f ( x ) / g ( x )  as a result of applying the lim operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called "" indeterminate form "". That does not mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of  f ( x ) / g ( x )  , if it exists, must be found by another method, such as l'Hpital's rule . [ 78 ] The sum of 0 numbers (the empty sum ) is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the empty product ) is 1. The factorial 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product. [ 79 ] Other uses in mathematics The empty set has zero elements The role of 0 as the smallest counting number can be generalized or extended in various ways. In set theory , 0 is the cardinality of the empty set (notated as "" "", ""  textstyle emptyset  "", or """"): if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is defined to be the empty set. [ 80 ] When this is done, the empty set is the von Neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements. Also in set theory, 0 is the lowest ordinal number , corresponding to the empty set viewed as a well-ordered set . In order theory (and especially its subfield lattice theory ), 0 may denote the least element of a lattice or other partially ordered set . The role of 0 as additive identity generalizes beyond elementary algebra. In abstract algebra , 0 is commonly used to denote a zero element , which is the identity element for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an absorbing element for multiplication (if defined). (Such elements may also be called zero elements .) Examples include identity elements of additive groups and vector spaces . Another example is the zero function (or zero map ) on a domain D . This is the constant function with 0 as its only possible output value, that is, it is the function f defined by f ( x )  0 for all x in D . As a function from the real numbers to the real numbers, the zero function is the only function that is both even and odd . The number 0 is also used in several other ways within various branches of mathematics: A zero of a function f is a point x in the domain of the function such that f ( x )  0 . In propositional logic , 0 may be used to denote the truth value false. In probability theory , 0 is the smallest allowed value for the probability of any event. [ 81 ] Category theory introduces the idea of a zero object , often denoted 0, and the related concept of zero morphisms , which generalize the zero function. [ 82 ] Physics The value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (typically measured in kelvins ), zero is the lowest possible value. ( Negative temperatures can be defined for some physical systems, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder.) This is in contrast to temperatures on the Celsius scale, for example, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons , the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference valuefor example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics , the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system. Computer science Modern computers store information in binary , that is, using an ""alphabet"" that contains only two symbols, usually chosen to be ""0"" and ""1"". Binary coding is convenient for digital electronics , where ""0"" and ""1"" can stand for the absence or presence of electrical current in a wire. [ 85 ] Computer programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than the binary instructions that are directly executed by the central processing unit . 0 plays various important roles in high-level languages. For example, a Boolean variable stores a value that is either true or false, and 0 is often the numerical representation of false. [ 86 ] 0 also plays a role in array indexing. The most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic programming languages such as Fortran and COBOL . [ 87 ] However, in the late 1950s LISP introduced zero-based numbering for arrays while Algol 58 introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. [ citation needed ] For example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in C , so that for an array of n items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to n 1 . [ 88 ] There can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing; for example, Java's JDBC indexes parameters from 1 although Java itself uses 0-based indexing. [ 89 ] In C, a byte containing the value 0 serves to indicate where a string of characters ends. Also, 0 is a standard way to refer to a null pointer in code. [ 90 ] In databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a null value . [ 91 ] For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to three-valued logic . No longer is a condition either true or false , but it can be undetermined . Any computation including a null value delivers a null result. [ 92 ] In mathematics, there is no ""positive zero"" or ""negative zero"" distinct from zero; both 0 and 0 represent exactly the same number. However, in some computer hardware signed number representations , zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives. This kind of dual representation is known as signed zero , with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. These representations include the signed magnitude and ones' complement binary integer representations (but not the two's complement binary form used in most modern computers), and most floating-point number representations (such as IEEE 754 and IBM S/390 floating-point formats). [ citation needed ] An epoch , in computing terminology, is the date and time associated with a zero timestamp. The Unix epoch begins the midnight before the first of January 1970. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ] The Classic Mac OS epoch and Palm OS epoch begin the midnight before the first of January 1904. [ 96 ] Many APIs and operating systems that require applications to return an integer value as an exit status typically use zero to indicate success and non-zero values to indicate specific error or warning conditions. [ 97 ] [ citation needed ] Programmers often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion with the letter "" O "". [ 98 ] Other fields Biology In comparative zoology and cognitive science , recognition that some animals display awareness of the concept of zero leads to the conclusion that the capability for numerical abstraction arose early in the evolution of species. [ 99 ] Dating systems Main article: Year zero In the BC calendar era , the year 1 BC is the first year before AD 1; there is not a year zero . By contrast, in astronomical year numbering , the year 1 BC is numbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered 1, and so forth. [ 100 ] See also Grammatical number Mathematical constant Number theory Peano axioms Notes  No long count date actually using the number 0 has been found before the 3rd century AD, but since the long count system would make no sense without some placeholder, and since Mesoamerican glyphs do not typically leave empty spaces, these earlier dates are taken as indirect evidence that the concept of 0 already existed at the time.  Each place in Ptolemy's sexagesimal system was written in Greek numerals from 0 to 59 , where 31 was written  meaning 301, and 20 was written  meaning 20. References  Harper, Douglas (2011).

The first known digit ""6"" in the number ""256"" in Ashoka's Minor Rock Edict No.1 in Sasaram , c. 250 BCE The evolution of our modern digit 6 appears rather simple when compared with the other digits. The modern 6 can be traced back to the Brahmi numerals of India , which are first known from the Edicts of Ashoka c. 250 BCE . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] It was written in one stroke like a cursive lowercase e rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Gradually, the upper part of the stroke (above the central squiggle) became more curved, while the lower part of the stroke (below the central squiggle) became straighter. The Arabs dropped the part of the stroke below the squiggle. From there, the European evolution to our modern 6 was very straightforward, aside from a flirtation with a glyph that looked more like an uppercase G. [ 28 ] On the seven-segment displays of calculators and watches, 6 is usually written with six segments. Some historical calculator models use just five segments for the 6, by omitting the top horizontal bar. This glyph variant has not caught on; for calculators that can display results in hexadecimal, a 6 that looks like a ""b"" is not practical. Just as in most modern typefaces , in typefaces with text figures the character for the digit 6 usually has an ascender , as, for example, in . [ 29 ] This digit resembles an inverted 9 . To disambiguate the two on objects and documents that can be inverted, the 6 has often been underlined, both in handwriting and on printed labels. The cells of a beehive are six-sided. Chemistry [ edit ] A molecule of benzene has a ring of six carbon and six hydrogen atoms . The sixfold symmetry of snowflakes arises from the hexagonal crystal structure of ordinary ice . [ 30 ] Anthropology [ edit ] A coffin is traditionally buried six feet under the ground; thus, the phrase ""six feet under"" means that a person (or thing, or concept) is dead [ 31 ] Six is a lucky number in Chinese culture . [ 32 ] ""Six"" is used as an informal slang term for the British Secret Intelligence Service , MI6. [ 33 ] See also [ edit ] Six degrees (disambiguation) .

The mysteries of those traditional conversions were a headache for generations of American visitors, but things are much easier now. England switched to a decimal system back in the 70s, meaning pence and pounds are just as easy to work with as dollars and cents. Advertisement Pence to Pounds to Dollars Conversion Image Credit: robynmac/iStock/GettyImages Video of the Day In For a Penny, In For a Pound Under the old coinage system, there were 240 pence to the pound. Currently, a pound breaks down to 100 pence just as a U.S. dollar breaks down to 100 pennies. The British have more coins in circulation, though, partly because the pound has a higher value than the dollar and partly because coins are used instead of bills for small denominations. What appear to be pennies might be 1- or 2-pence coins, and there are also 5 pence, 10 pence, 20 pence and 50 pence denominations. They're much like American quarters, dimes and nickels, except for the extra two coins at the higher and lower ends. There are also coins in 1-pound, 2-pound and 5-pound denominations, so be careful when handing over a fist full of change as a tip at a cafe. Your tip could easily be more than the cost of the meal.

The U.S. dollar and U.K. pound change value every day, so this is a bit of a moving target, but checking on the day you arrive is close enough for quick mental math. At the time this was written, for example, 1 British pound was worth 1.39 USD, so if that must-read book for the flight home costs 15, it would work out to 20.85. Don't get too hung up on local cost, though, unless it's something you're planning to take home. Costs in every country will vary, so focus less on what things cost in U.S. dollars and more on whether your planned purchase is a good deal in local terms. Advertisement Exchanging Your Dollars for Pounds Using your credit card whenever possible makes a lot of sense, while you're traveling because currency exchange is done for you automatically and you don't have to waste any thought on it. It's always a good idea to let your card issuer let you know this ahead of time, of course, so their automated fraud-prevention systems don't lock down your card when it suddenly starts ringing up purchases in London. You'll still need to exchange at least some of your dollars for pounds, though, for tips and small purchases. Fodor's advises simply using the nearest ATM: You'll pay some fees but you'll get your bank's official exchange rate on the day, often as little as a 1 percent premium. That's usually a better deal than taking a lower exchange rate from the ""no fees"" currency exchange at the airport. Bear in mind that those ATM fees are charged per withdrawal, so you're better off making a few large withdrawals than several small ones.

Start checking your money exchange options a day or two ahead of time, comparing them to the official exchange rate. If today's rate is 1.39 USD per pound, for example, you'd ideally choose a currency exchange operator offering 1.29 over one offering 1.14. You also have the option of waiting until you get home, and using the Travelex exchange service at the airport to turn what's left into U.S. dollars. The best option of all may be the simplest: Spend whatever U.K. currency you have left on the last day, keeping back a small reserve for coffee, drinks or snacks at the airport.

What follows is a complete list of operators. At this point, it is likely not necessary to know all of them, but they are all listed here to also serve as reference. Assignment operator () The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. 1 x  5; This statement assigns the integer value 5 to the variable x . The assignment operation always takes place from right to left, and never the other way around: 1 x  y; This statement assigns to variable x the value contained in variable y . The value of x at the moment this statement is executed is lost and replaced by the value of y . Consider also that we are only assigning the value of y to x at the moment of the assignment operation. Therefore, if y changes at a later moment, it will not affect the new value taken by x . For example, let's have a look at the following code - I have included the evolution of the content stored in the variables as comments: // assignment operator include iostream using namespace std; int main ()  int a, b; // a:?,  b:? a  10; // a:10, b:? b  4; // a:10, b:4 a  b; // a:4,  b:4 b  7; // a:4,  b:7 cout  ""a:"" ;   cout  a;   cout  "" b:"" ;   cout  b;  a:4 b:7 This program prints on screen the final values of a and b (4 and 7, respectively). Notice how a was not affected by the final modification of b , even though we declared a  b earlier. Assignment operations are expressions that can be evaluated. That means that the assignment itself has a value, and -for fundamental types- this value is the one assigned in the operation. For example: 1 y  2  (x  5); In this expression, y is assigned the result of adding 2 and the value of another assignment expression (which has itself a value of 5). It is roughly equivalent to: 1 2 x  5; y  2  x; With the final result of assigning 7 to y . The following expression is also valid in C: 1 x  y  z  5; It assigns 5 to the all three variables: x , y and z ; always from right-to-left. Arithmetic operators ( , -, , /,  ) The five arithmetical operations supported by C are: operator description  addition - subtraction  multiplication / division  modulo Operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division correspond literally to their respective mathematical operators. The last one, modulo operator , represented by a percentage sign (  ), gives the remainder of a division of two values. For example: 1 x  11  3; results in variable x containing the value 2, since dividing 11 by 3 results in 3, with a remainder of 2. Compound assignment (, -, , /, , , , , , ) Compound assignment operators modify the current value of a variable by performing an operation on it. They are equivalent to assigning the result of an operation to the first operand: expression equivalent to... y  x; y  y  x; x - 5; x  x - 5; x / y; x  x / y; price  units  1; price  price  (units1); and the same for all other compound assignment operators. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // compound assignment operators include iostream using namespace std; int main ()  int a, b3;   a  b;   a2; // equivalent to aa2 cout  a;  5 Increment and decrement (, --) Some expression can be shortened even more: the increase operator (  ) and the decrease operator ( -- ) increase or reduce by one the value stored in a variable. They are equivalent to 1 and to -1 , respectively. Thus: 1 2 3 x; x1; xx1; are all equivalent in its functionality; the three of them increase by one the value of x . In the early C compilers, the three previous expressions may have produced different executable code depending on which one was used. Nowadays, this type of code optimization is generally performed automatically by the compiler, thus the three expressions should produce exactly the same executable code. A peculiarity of this operator is that it can be used both as a prefix and as a suffix. That means that it can be written either before the variable name ( x ) or after it ( x ). Although in simple expressions like x or x , both have exactly the same meaning; in other expressions in which the result of the increment or decrement operation is evaluated, they may have an important difference in their meaning: In the case that the increase operator is used as a prefix ( x ) of the value, the expression evaluates to the final value of x , once it is already increased. On the other hand, in case that it is used as a suffix ( x ), the value is also increased, but the expression evaluates to the value that x had before being increased. Notice the difference: Example 1 Example 2 x  3; y  x; // x contains 4, y contains 4 x  3; y  x; // x contains 4, y contains 3 In Example 1 , the value assigned to y is the value of x after being increased. While in Example 2 , it is the value x had before being increased. Relational and comparison operators ( , !, , , ,  ) Two expressions can be compared using relational and equality operators. For example, to know if two values are equal or if one is greater than the other. The result of such an operation is either true or false (i.e., a Boolean value). The relational operators in C are: operator description  Equal to ! Not equal to  Less than  Greater than  Less than or equal to  Greater than or equal to Here there are some examples: 1 2 3 4 5 (7  5) // evaluates to false (5  4) // evaluates to true (3 ! 2) // evaluates to true (6  6) // evaluates to true (5  5) // evaluates to false Of course, it's not just numeric constants that can be compared, but just any value, including, of course, variables. Suppose that a2 , b3 and c6 , then: 1 2 3 4 (a  5) // evaluates to false, since a is not equal to 5 (ab  c) // evaluates to true, since (23  6) is true (b4  ac) // evaluates to false, since (34  26) is false ((b2)  a) // evaluates to true Be careful! The assignment operator (operator  , with one equal sign) is not the same as the equality comparison operator (operator  , with two equal signs); the first one (  ) assigns the value on the right-hand to the variable on its left, while the other (  ) compares whether the values on both sides of the operator are equal. Therefore, in the last expression ( (b2)  a ), we first assigned the value 2 to b and then we compared it to a (that also stores the value 2), yielding true . Logical operators ( !, ,  ) The operator ! is the C operator for the Boolean operation NOT. It has only one operand, to its right, and inverts it, producing false if its operand is true , and true if its operand is false . Basically, it returns the opposite Boolean value of evaluating its operand. For example: 1 2 3 4 !(5  5) // evaluates to false because the expression at its right (5  5) is true !(6  4) // evaluates to true because (6  4) would be false ! true // evaluates to false ! false // evaluates to true The logical operators  and  are used when evaluating two expressions to obtain a single relational result. The operator  corresponds to the Boolean logical operation AND, which yields true if both its operands are true , and false otherwise. The following panel shows the result of operator  evaluating the expression ab :  OPERATOR (and) a b a  b true true true true false false false true false false false false The operator  corresponds to the Boolean logical operation OR, which yields true if either of its operands is true , thus being false only when both operands are false. Here are the possible results of ab :  OPERATOR (or) a b a  b true true true true false true false true true false false false For example: 1 2 ( (5  5)  (3  6) ) // evaluates to false ( true  false ) ( (5  5)  (3  6) ) // evaluates to true ( true  false ) When using the logical operators, C only evaluates what is necessary from left to right to come up with the combined relational result, ignoring the rest. Therefore, in the last example ( (55)(36) ), C evaluates first whether 55 is true , and if so, it never checks whether 36 is true or not. This is known as short-circuit evaluation , and works like this for these operators: operator short-circuit  if the left-hand side expression is false , the combined result is false (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated).  if the left-hand side expression is true , the combined result is true (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated). This is mostly important when the right-hand expression has side effects, such as altering values: 1 if ( (i10)  (in) )  /.../  // note that the condition increments i Here, the combined conditional expression would increase i by one, but only if the condition on the left of  is true , because otherwise, the condition on the right-hand side ( in ) is never evaluated. Conditional ternary operator ( ? ) The conditional operator evaluates an expression, returning one value if that expression evaluates to true , and a different one if the expression evaluates as false . Its syntax is: condition ? result1 : result2 If condition is true , the entire expression evaluates to result1 , and otherwise to result2 . 1 2 3 4 75 ? 4 : 3 // evaluates to 3, since 7 is not equal to 5. 752 ? 4 : 3 // evaluates to 4, since 7 is equal to 52. 53 ? a : b // evaluates to the value of a, since 5 is greater than 3. ab ? a : b // evaluates to whichever is greater, a or b. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // conditional operator include iostream using namespace std; int main ()  int a,b,c;    a2;   b7;   c  (ab) ? a : b;    cout  c  'n' ;  7 In this example, a was 2, and b was 7, so the expression being evaluated ( ab ) was not true , thus the first value specified after the question mark was discarded in favor of the second value (the one after the colon) which was b (with a value of 7). Comma operator ( , ) The comma operator ( , ) is used to separate two or more expressions that are included where only one expression is expected. When the set of expressions has to be evaluated for a value, only the right-most expression is considered. For example, the following code: 1 a  (b3, b2); would first assign the value 3 to b , and then assign b2 to variable a . So, at the end, variable a would contain the value 5 while variable b would contain value 3. Bitwise operators ( , , , , ,  ) Bitwise operators modify variables considering the bit patterns that represent the values they store. operator asm equivalent description  AND Bitwise AND  OR Bitwise inclusive OR  XOR Bitwise exclusive OR  NOT Unary complement (bit inversion)  SHL Shift bits left  SHR Shift bits right Explicit type casting operator Type casting operators allow to convert a value of a given type to another type. There are several ways to do this in C. The simplest one, which has been inherited from the C language, is to precede the expression to be converted by the new type enclosed between parentheses (()): 1 2 3 int i; float f  3.14; i  ( int ) f; The previous code converts the floating-point number 3.14 to an integer value ( 3 ); the remainder is lost. Here, the typecasting operator was (int) . Another way to do the same thing in C is to use the functional notation preceding the expression to be converted by the type and enclosing the expression between parentheses: 1 i  int (f); Both ways of casting types are valid in C. sizeof This operator accepts one parameter, which can be either a type or a variable, and returns the size in bytes of that type or object: 1 x  sizeof ( char ); Here, x is assigned the value 1 , because char is a type with a size of one byte. The value returned by sizeof is a compile-time constant, so it is always determined before program execution. Other operators Later in these tutorials, we will see a few more operators, like the ones referring to pointers or the specifics for object-oriented programming. Precedence of operators A single expression may have multiple operators. For example: 1 x  5  7  2; In C, the above expression always assigns 6 to variable x , because the  operator has a higher precedence than the  operator, and is always evaluated before. Parts of the expressions can be enclosed in parenthesis to override this precedence order, or to make explicitly clear the intended effect. Notice the difference: 1 2 x  5  (7  2); // x  6 (same as without parenthesis) x  (5  7)  2; // x  0 From greatest to smallest priority, C operators are evaluated in the following order: Level Precedence group Operator Description Grouping 1 Scope :: scope qualifier Left-to-right 2 Postfix (unary)  -- postfix increment / decrement Left-to-right () functional forms [] subscript . - member access 3 Prefix (unary)  -- prefix increment / decrement Right-to-left  ! bitwise NOT / logical NOT  - unary prefix   reference / dereference new delete allocation / deallocation sizeof parameter pack ( type ) C-style type-casting 4 Pointer-to-member . - access pointer Left-to-right 5 Arithmetic: scaling  /  multiply, divide, modulo Left-to-right 6 Arithmetic: addition  - addition, subtraction Left-to-right 7 Bitwise shift   shift left, shift right Left-to-right 8 Relational     comparison operators Left-to-right 9 Equality  ! equality / inequality Left-to-right 10 And  bitwise AND Left-to-right 11 Exclusive or  bitwise XOR Left-to-right 12 Inclusive or  bitwise OR Left-to-right 13 Conjunction  logical AND Left-to-right 14 Disjunction  logical OR Left-to-right 15 Assignment-level expressions   /   -      assignment / compound assignment Right-to-left ?: conditional operator 16 Sequencing , comma separator Left-to-right When an expression has two operators with the same precedence level, grouping determines which one is evaluated first: either left-to-right or right-to-left. Enclosing all sub-statements in parentheses (even those unnecessary because of their precedence) improves code readability.

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation . [ 33 ] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected . It supports multiple programming paradigms , including structured (particularly procedural ), object-oriented and functional programming . It is often described as a ""batteries included"" language due to its comprehensive standard library . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. [ 36 ] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. [ 37 ] Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Python The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum , at PyCon US 2024 Python was conceived in the late 1980s [ 42 ] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde  Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL , [ 43 ] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. [ 12 ] Its implementation began in December 1989. [ 44 ] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's "" benevolent dictator for life "" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker [ 45 ] (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] The name Python is said to come from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus . [ 48 ] Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions , cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting , and Unicode support. [ 49 ] Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] It no longer receives security patches or updates. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy , continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18"" (plus 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) "" backported security updates"". [ 54 ] Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, with some new semantics and changed syntax. At least every Python release since (now unsupported) 3.5 has added some syntax to the language, and a few later releases have dropped outdated modules, and changed semantics, at least in a minor way. As of 12 March 2025 [update] , Python 3.13 is the latest stable release. Python 3.13 currently receives full bug-fix and security updates, while Python 3.12released in October 2023will have active bug-fix support only until April 2025. Python 3.9 [ 55 ] is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.8 reaching end-of-life . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half), followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before). Security updates were expedited in 2021 (and again twice in 2022, and more fixed in 2023 and in September 2024 for Python 3.12.6 down to 3.8.20), since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7 [ 58 ] ) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution [ 59 ] and web-cache poisoning . [ 60 ] Python 3.10 added the  union type operator [ 61 ] and the match and case keywords (for structural pattern matching statements). 3.11 expanded exception handling functionality. Python 3.12 added the new keyword type . Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting. [ 62 ] Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60 faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5 on top of that. It also has improved error messages (again improved in 3.14), and many other changes. Python 3.13 introduces more syntax for types, a new and improved interactive interpreter ( REPL ), featuring multi-line editing and color support; an incremental garbage collector (producing shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects, and addition to the improved speed in 3.11 and 3.12),  and an experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler (such features, can/needs to be enabled specifically for the increase in speed), [ 63 ] and an experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the global interpreter lock (GIL), allowing threads to run more concurrently, that latter feature enabled with python3.13t or python3.13t.exe . Python 3.13 introduces some change in behavior, i.e. new ""well-defined semantics"", fixing bugs (plus many removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods, and removed some of the C API and outdated modules): ""The  [old] implementation of locals() and frame.f_locals is slow, inconsistent and buggy [and it] has many corner cases and oddities. Code that works around those may need to be changed. Code that uses locals() for simple templating, or print debugging, will continue to work correctly."" [ 64 ] Python 3.13 introduces the experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), a feature of CPython that previously prevented multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This optional build, introduced through PEP 703, enables better exploitation of multi-core CPUs. By allowing multiple threads to run Python code in parallel, the free-threaded mode addresses long-standing performance bottlenecks associated with the GIL, offering a new path for parallelism in Python without resorting to multiprocessing or external concurrency frameworks. [ 65 ] Some (more) standard library modules and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, will be removed in Python 3.15 or 3.16. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Python 3.11 adds Sigstore digital verification signatures for all CPython artifacts (in addition to PGP ). Since use of PGP has been criticized by security practitioners,  Python is moving to Sigstore exclusively and dropping PGP from 3.14. [ 68 ] Python 3.14 is now in alpha 3; regarding possible change to annotations: ""In Python 3.14, from __future__ import annotations will continue to work as it did before, converting annotations into strings."" [ 69 ] PEP 711 proposes PyBI: a standard format for distributing Python Binaries. [ 70 ] Python 3.15 will ""Make UTF-8 mode default"", [ 71 ] the mode exists in all current Python versions, but currently needs to be opted into. UTF-8 is already used, by default, on Windows (and elsewhere), for most things, but e.g. to open files it's not and enabling also makes code fully cross-platform, i.e. use UTF-8 for everything on all platforms. Design philosophy and features [ edit ] Python is a multi-paradigm programming language . Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming [ 72 ] and metaobjects ). [ 73 ] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract [ 74 ] [ 75 ] and logic programming . [ 76 ] Python is often referred to as a 'glue language ' [ 77 ] because it can seamlessly integrate components written in other languages. Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management . [ 78 ] It uses dynamic name resolution ( late binding ), which binds method and variable names during program execution. Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter , map and reduce functions; list comprehensions , dictionaries , sets, and generator expressions. [ 79 ] The standard library has two modules ( itertools and functools ) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML . [ 80 ] Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as: [ 81 ] Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. However, Python features regularly violate these principles and have received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat. [ 82 ] Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. [ 83 ] The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC , which espoused the opposite approach. [ 42 ] Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl 's "" there is more than one way to do it "" motto, Python embraces a ""there should be oneand preferably only oneobvious way to do it."" philosophy. [ 81 ] In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. [ 86 ] Alex Martelli , a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: ""To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."" [ 87 ] Python's developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. [ 88 ] Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy . It is also possible to cross-compile to other languages , but it either doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python is a very dynamic language , or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed. [ 89 ] Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its namea tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python [ 90 ] and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms ""spam"" and ""eggs"" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch ) in examples, instead of the often-used ""foo"" and ""bar"" . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic , which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. ""Pythonic"" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. [ 93 ] Syntax and semantics [ edit ] Main article: Python syntax and semantics An example of Python code and indentation Example of C code with curly braces and semicolons Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal . [ 94 ] Indentation [ edit ] Main article: Python syntax and semantics  Indentation Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks . An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. [ 95 ] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. [ 96 ] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule . Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces. [ 97 ] Statements and control flow [ edit ] Python's statements include: The assignment statement, using a single equals sign  The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else if ) The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except in Python 3.11 for exception groups [ 98 ] ); it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class , for use in object-oriented programming The def statement, which defines a function or method The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file ), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom [ 99 ] The break statement, which exits a loop The continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next The del statement, which removes a variabledeleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined The pass statement, serving as a NOP , syntactically needed to create an empty code block The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines The return statement, used to return a value from a function The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program The match and case statements, an analog of the switch statement construct, that compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-of-flow measure. The assignment statement (  ) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object . Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type ; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations , and, according to Van Rossum, it never will. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] However, better support for coroutine -like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators . [ 102 ] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators ; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels. [ 103 ] Expressions [ edit ] Python's expressions include: The  , - , and  operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point / division. [ 104 ] Python uses the  operator for exponentiation. Python uses the  operator for string concatenation. Python uses the  operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times. The  infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] The syntax : , called the ""walrus operator"", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. [ 107 ] In Python,  compares by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chainedfor example, a  b  c . Python uses and , or , and not as Boolean operators. Python has a type of expression named a list comprehension , and a more general expression named a generator expression . [ 79 ] Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions ; however, there may be only one expression in each body. Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y [ 108 ] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages). Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples . Lists are written as [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The  operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , executing t  t  ( 4 , 5 ) first evaluates t  ( 4 , 5 ) , which yields ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) , which is then assigned back to t thereby effectively ""modifying the contents"" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. [ 109 ] Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned (to a variable, writable property, etc.) are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literalsand, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. [ 110 ] Python has a ""string format"" operator  that functions analogously to printf format strings in Ce.g. ""spam s eggs d ""  ( ""blah"" , 2 ) evaluates to ""spamblah eggs2"" . In Python 2.6 and 3, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. ""spam 0 eggs 1 "" . format ( ""blah"" , 2 ) . Python 3.6 added ""f-strings"": spam  ""blah"" ; eggs  2 ; f 'spam  spam  eggs  eggs  ' . [ 111 ] Strings in Python can be concatenated by ""adding"" them (with the same operator as for adding integers and floats), e.g. ""spam""  ""eggs"" returns ""spameggs"" . If strings contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. ""2""  ""2"" returns ""22"" . Python has various string literals : Delimited by single or double quotes; unlike in Unix shells , Perl , and Perl-influenced languages, single and double quotes work the same. Both use the backslash (  ) as an escape character . String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as ""formatted string literals"". [ 111 ] Triple-quoted (beginning and ending with three single or double quotes), which may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby . Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r . Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows -style paths. (Compare ""  -quoting"" in C .) Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, denoted as a[key] , a [ start : stop ] or a [ start : stop : step ] . Indexes are zero-based , and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride , allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omittedfor example, a [:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy . In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp , Scheme , or Ruby . This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example: List comprehensions vs. for -loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements Statements cannot be a part of an expressionso list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions , all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as a  1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. Methods [ edit ] Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance . method ( argument ) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class . method ( instance , argument ) . Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data , in contrast to the implicit self (or this ) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C , Java , Objective-C , Ruby ). [ 112 ] Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations and type conversion. [ 113 ] Typing [ edit ] The standard type hierarchy in Python 3 Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time ; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed , Python is strongly typed , forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes , most often used for object-oriented programming . New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass () or EggsClass () ), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection . Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax): old-style and new-style ; [ 114 ] current Python versions only support the semantics of the new style. Python supports optional type annotations . [ 4 ] [ 115 ] These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Mypy also supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization. [ 118 ] Summary of Python 3's built-in types Type Mutability Description Syntax examples bool immutable Boolean value True False bytearray mutable Sequence of bytes bytearray ( b 'Some ASCII' ) bytearray ( b ""Some ASCII"" ) bytearray ([ 119 , 105 , 107 , 105 ]) bytes immutable Sequence of bytes b 'Some ASCII' b ""Some ASCII"" bytes ([ 119 , 105 , 107 , 105 ]) complex immutable Complex number with real and imaginary parts 3  2.7 j 3  2.7 j dict mutable Associative array (or dictionary) of key and value pairs; can contain mixed types (keys and values), keys must be a hashable type  'key1' : 1.0 , 3 : False   types.EllipsisType immutable An ellipsis placeholder to be used as an index in NumPy arrays ... Ellipsis float immutable Double-precision floating-point number . The precision is machine-dependent but in practice is generally implemented as a 64-bit IEEE 754 number with 53 bits of precision. [ 119 ] 1.33333 frozenset immutable Unordered set , contains no duplicates; can contain mixed types, if hashable frozenset ([ 4.0 , 'string' , True ]) int immutable Integer of unlimited magnitude [ 120 ] 42 list mutable List , can contain mixed types [ 4.0 , 'string' , True ] [] types.NoneType immutable An object representing the absence of a value, often called null in other languages None types.NotImplementedType immutable A placeholder that can be returned from overloaded operators to indicate unsupported operand types. NotImplemented range immutable An immutable sequence of numbers commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops [ 121 ] range (  1 , 10 ) range ( 10 ,  5 ,  2 ) set mutable Unordered set , contains no duplicates; can contain mixed types, if hashable  4.0 , 'string' , True  set () str immutable A character string : sequence of Unicode codepoints 'Wikipedia' ""Wikipedia"" """"""Spanning multiple lines"""""" Spanning multiple lines tuple immutable Can contain mixed types ( 4.0 , 'string' , True ) ( 'single element' ,) () Arithmetic operations [ edit ] Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (  , - ,  , / ), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation  (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4  -3  -2 ). It also has  for exponentiation , e.g. 53  125 and 90.5  3.0 , and a matrixmultiplication operator  . [ 122 ] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules , the operators infix (  and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively). The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time: [ 123 ] Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5 / 2  2.5 . The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3  2 , -7//3  -3 , 7.5//3  2.0 and -7.5//3  -3.0 . Adding from __future__ import division causes a module used in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see above). In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division ), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division . [ 123 ] Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation ( a  b ) // b  a // b  1 is always true. It also means that the equation b  ( a // b )  a  b  a is valid for both positive and negative values of a . However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of ab is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b ), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval ( b , 0] when b is negative. [ 124 ] Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking , Python 3 uses round to even : round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2 . [ 125 ] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero : round(0.5) is 1.0 , round(-0.5) is 1.0 . [ 126 ] Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a  b  c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c . [ 127 ] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a  b , resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c . [ 128 ] Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. [ 129 ] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers . [ 130 ] Due to Python's extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy , it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] Function syntax [ edit ] Functions are created in Python using the def keyword. In Python, you define the function as if you were calling it, by typing the function name and then the attributes required. Here is an example of a function that will print whatever is given: def printer ( input1 , input2  ""already there"" ): print ( input1 ) print ( input2 ) printer ( ""hello"" )  Example output:  hello  already there If you want the attribute to have a set value if no value is given, use the variable-defining syntax inside the function definition. Programming examples [ edit ] ""Hello, World!"" program : print ( 'Hello, world!' ) Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer: n  int ( input ( 'Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: ' )) if n  0 : raise ValueError ( 'You must enter a non-negative integer' ) factorial  1 for i in range ( 2 , n  1 ): factorial  i print ( factorial ) Libraries [ edit ] Python's large standard library [ 133 ] is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces , connecting to relational databases , generating pseudorandom numbers , arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, [ 129 ] manipulating regular expressions , and unit testing . Some parts of the standard library are covered by specificationsfor example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333 [ 134 ] but most are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites . However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of 13 March 2025, [update] the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339 [ 135 ] packages with a wide range of functionality, including: Automation Data analytics Databases Documentation Graphical user interfaces Image processing Machine learning Mobile apps Multimedia Computer networking Scientific computing System administration Test frameworks Text processing Web frameworks Web scraping Development environments [ edit ] See also: Comparison of integrated development environments  Python Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a readevalprint loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately. Python also comes with an Integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE , which is more beginner-oriented. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython , add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention, and syntax highlighting . As well as standard desktop integrated development environments including PyCharm, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code etc, there are web browser -based IDEs, including SageMath , for developing science- and math-related programs; Jupyter Notebooks , an open-source interactive computing platform; PythonAnywhere , a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE emphasizing scientific computing . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Implementations [ edit ] See also: List of Python software  Python implementations Reference implementation [ edit ] CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard (Python 3.11 uses C11 [ 138 ] ) with several select C99 features. CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versionse.g. they can be implemented with C11 or C. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode [ 141 ] which is then executed by its virtual machine . [ 142 ] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python, and is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; [ 143 ] [ 144 ] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer), with unofficial support for VMS . [ 145 ] Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities. [ 146 ] (During Python 1 and 2 development, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported, [ 147 ] but support has since been dropped for many platforms.) All current Python versions (i.e. since 3.7) only support operating systems with multi-threading support. Other implementations [ edit ] All alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics (e.g. may have unordered dictionaries, unlike all current Python versions), e.g. with the larger Python ecosystem, such as with supporting the C Python API of with PyPy: PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and  3.10. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Its just-in-time compiler often brings a significant speed improvement over CPython, but some libraries written in C cannot be used with it. [ 150 ] It has e.g. RISC-V support. Codon is a language with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler , that (AOT) compiles a statically-typed Python-like language with ""syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python's, there are some notable differences"" [ 151 ] e.g. it uses 64-bit machine integers, for speed, not arbitrary like Python, and it claims speedups over CPython are usually on the order of 10100x. It compiles to machine code (via LLVM ) and supports native multithreading. [ 152 ] Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python. Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads ; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version. [ 153 ] MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers , including Lego Mindstorms EV3 . [ 154 ] Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs. [ 155 ] Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT , and an experimental bytecode compiler. [ 156 ] Snek [ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ 159 ] Embedded Computing Language (compatible with e.g. 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P -based Arduino, as well as larger ones compatible with MicroPython ) ""is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek."" [ 160 ] It is an imperative language not including OOP / classes, unlike Python, and simplifying to one number type with 32-bit single-precision (similar to JavaScript , except smaller). No longer supported implementations [ edit ] Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported: Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter five-fold by using the LLVM , and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, [ 161 ] while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock . Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later. PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. [ 162 ] Cross-compilers to other languages [ edit ] There are several compilers/ transpilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language: Brython, [ 163 ] Transcrypt [ 164 ] [ 165 ] and Pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile Python to JavaScript . Cython compiles (a superset of) Python to C. The resulting code is also usable with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter. PyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to ""human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code"". [ 89 ] Despite claiming high performance, no tool can claim to do that for arbitrary Python code; i.e. it's known not possible to compile to a faster language or machine code. Unless semantics of Python are changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python, or compiled to machine code, and based that way. Nuitka compiles Python into C. [ 166 ] It works with Python 3.4 to 3.12 (and 2.6 and 2.7), for Python's main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. It claims complete support for Python 3.10,  some support for 3.11 and 3.12  and experimental support for Python 3.13. It supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based.  It's a free compiler, though it also has commercial add-ons (e.g. for hiding source code). Numba is used from Python, as a tool (enabled by adding a decorator to relevant Python code), a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C ( C11 ). [ 167 ] RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python. The Python  11l  C transpiler [ 168 ] compiles a subset of Python 3 to C ( C17 ). Specialized: MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL), that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code. Older projects (or not to be used with Python 3.x and latest syntax): Google's Grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles Python 2 to Go . [ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ] IronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs (and an alpha , released in 2021, is also available for ""Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included"" [ 172 ] ) on the .NET Common Language Runtime . [ 173 ] Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program. [ 174 ] Pyrex (latest release in 2010) and Shed Skin (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C respectively. Performance [ edit ] Performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13. [ 175 ] Python's performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game . [ 176 ] There are some ways of optimizing performance due to the slower nature of Python being an interpreted language . These optimizations use different strategies or tools: Just-in-time compilation : Compiling code just before it is executed dynamically. These implementations are seen in libraries like Numba and PyPy . Static compilation : Code gets compiled into machine code before execution. An example of this is Cython which compiles Python into C. Concurrency and Parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run at the same time. Python contains modules like multiprocessing to allow for this form of parallelism. Additionally, it helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks. Efficient Data Structures: Using data types such as Set for membership tests or deque from collections for queue operations can also improve performance. Development [ edit ] Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. [ 177 ] Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. [ 178 ] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council. [ 177 ] Enhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at by the foundation. [ 179 ] In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub . [ 180 ] Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial , until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017. [ 181 ] CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported . The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequentlyversion 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 is very unlikely to ever happen. [ 182 ] Major or ""feature"" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to happen annually. [ 183 ] [ 184 ] Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release. [ 185 ] Bug fix releases, [ 186 ] which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented. [ 186 ] Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. [ 187 ] The major academic conference on Python is PyCon . There are also special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies . Python 3.12 removed wstr meaning Python extensions [ 188 ] need to be modified, [ 189 ] and 3.10 added pattern matching to the language. [ 190 ] Python 3.12 dropped some outdated modules, and more will be dropped in the future, deprecated as of 3.13; already deprecated array 'u' format code will emit DeprecationWarning since 3.13 and will be removed in Python 3.16. The 'w' format code should be used instead. Part of ctypes is also deprecated and http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler will emit a DeprecationWarning, and will be removed in 3.15. Using that code already has a high potential for both security and functionality bugs. Parts of the typing module are deprecated, e.g. creating a typing.NamedTuple class using keyword arguments to denote the fields and such (and more) will be disallowed in Python 3.15. API documentation generators [ edit ] Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of the standard library), Sphinx , Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz , among others. [ 191 ] Naming [ edit ] Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python , whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; [ 192 ] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar . [ 192 ] [ 193 ] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Users of Python are sometimes referred to as ""Pythonistas"". [ 196 ] The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame , a binding of Simple DirectMedia Layer to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK , which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy , a Python implementation originally written in Python. Popularity [ edit ] Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where as of December 2022 [update] it was the most popular language (ahead of C, C, and Java ). [ 40 ] It was selected as Programming Language of the Year (for ""the highest rise in ratings in a year"") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to have done so four times as of 2020 [update] [ 197 ] ). In the TIOBE Index, monthly rankings are based on the volume of searches for programming languages on Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing, and 20 other platforms. According to the accompanying graph, Python has shown a marked upward trend since the early 2000s, eventually passing long-established languages such as C, C, and Java. This progression can be attributed to Pythons readable syntax, comprehensive standard library, and application in data science and machine learning fields [ 198 ] . TIOBE Index Chart showing Python's popularity compared to other programming languages. Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia , Google , [ 199 ] Yahoo! , [ 200 ] CERN , [ 201 ] NASA , [ 202 ] Facebook , [ 203 ] Amazon , Instagram , [ 204 ] Spotify , [ 205 ] and some smaller entities like Industrial Light  Magic [ 206 ] and ITA . [ 207 ] The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python. [ 208 ] Organizations that partially use Python include Discord [ 209 ] and Baidu . [ 210 ] Uses [ edit ] Main article: List of Python software Python Powered Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications , e.g. via mod_wsgi for the Apache webserver . [ 211 ] With Web Server Gateway Interface , a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django , Pylons , Pyramid , TurboGears , web2py , Tornado , Flask , Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox . Libraries such as NumPy , SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, [ 212 ] [ 213 ] with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics , including algebra , combinatorics , numerical mathematics , number theory , and calculus . [ 214 ] OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing . [ 215 ] Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow , Keras , Pytorch , scikit-learn and the Logic language ProbLog . [ 216 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] [ 219 ] [ 220 ] As a scripting language with a modular architecture , simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing . [ 221 ] The combination of Python and Prolog has proved to be particularly useful for AI applications, with Prolog providing knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. The Janus system, in particular, exploits the similarities between these two languages, in part because of their use of dynamic typing, and the simple recursive nature of their data structures. Typical applications of this combination include  natural language processing, visual query answering, geospatial reasoning, and handling of semantic web data. [ 222 ] [ 223 ] The Natlog system, implemented in Python, uses Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) as prompt generators for text-to-text generators like GPT3 and text-to-image generators like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion. [ 224 ] Python can also be used for graphical user interface (GUI) by using libraries like Tkinter . [ 225 ] [ 226 ] Python is embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus , 3D parametric modelers like FreeCAD , 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max , Blender , Cinema 4D , Lightwave , Houdini , Maya , modo , MotionBuilder , Softimage , the visual effects compositor Nuke , 2D imaging programs like GIMP , [ 227 ] Inkscape , Scribus and Paint Shop Pro , [ 228 ] and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella . GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS . [ 229 ] It has also been used in several video games, [ 230 ] [ 231 ] and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine , the other two being Java and Go . [ 232 ] Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions , [ 233 ] AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD , and OpenBSD (as a package) and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system , Portage . Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development. [ 234 ] [ 235 ] Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, developed at Sugar Labs as of 2008 [update] , is written in Python. [ 236 ] The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language. LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature [ 237 ] since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013. Languages influenced by Python [ edit ] Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages: Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model. [ 238 ] Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its Acknowledgements document lists Python first among languages that influenced it. [ 239 ] CoffeeScript , a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax. ECMAScript  JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python. [ 240 ] GDScript , a scripting language very similar to Python, built-in to the Godot game engine. [ 241 ] Go is designed for the ""speed of working in a dynamic language like Python"" [ 242 ] and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays. Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java . [ 243 ] Julia was designed to be ""as usable for general programming as Python"". [ 27 ] Mojo is a non-strict [ 28 ] [ 244 ] superset of Python (e.g. still missing classes, and adding e.g. struct ). [ 245 ] Nim uses indentation and similar syntax. [ 246 ] Ruby 's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto , has said: ""I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."" [ 247 ] Swift , a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax. [ 248 ] Kotlin blends Python and Java features, minimizing boilerplate code for enhanced developer efficiency. [ 249 ] Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in Tcl , [ 250 ] Erlang , [ 251 ] and Swift.

Mojo as a member of the Python family [..] Embracing Python massively simplifies our design efforts, because most of the syntax is already specified.  [..] we decided that the right long-term goal for Mojo is to provide a superset of Python (i.e. be compatible with existing programs) and to embrace the CPython immediately for long-tail ecosystem enablement. To a Python programmer, we expect and hope that Mojo will be immediately familiar, while also providing new tools for developing systems-level code that enable you to do things that Python falls back to C and C for.

In SQL , null or NULL is a special marker used to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database . Introduced by the creator of the relational database model, E. F. Codd , SQL null serves to fulfill the requirement that all true relational database management systems ( RDBMS ) support a representation of ""missing information and inapplicable information"".  Codd also introduced the use of the lowercase Greek omega () symbol to represent null in database theory .  In SQL, NULL is a reserved word used to identify this marker. A null should not be confused with a value of 0 . A null indicates a lack of a value, which is not the same as a zero value. For example, consider the question ""How many books does Adam own?"" The answer may be ""zero"" (we know that he owns none ) or ""null"" (we do not know how many he owns). In a database table, the column reporting this answer would start with no value (marked by null), and it would not be updated with the value zero until it is ascertained that Adam owns no books. In SQL, null is a marker, not a value. This usage is quite different from most programming languages, where a null value of a reference means it is not pointing to any object . History [ edit ] E. F. Codd mentioned nulls as a method of representing missing data in the relational model in a 1975 paper in the FDT Bulletin of ACM - SIGMOD . Codd's paper that is most commonly cited with the semantics of Null (as adopted in SQL) is his 1979 paper in the ACM Transactions on Database Systems , in which he also introduced his Relational Model/Tasmania , although much of the other proposals from the latter paper have remained obscure. Section 2.3 of his 1979 paper details the semantics of Null propagation in arithmetic operations as well as comparisons employing a ternary (three-valued) logic when comparing to nulls; it also details the treatment of Nulls on other set operations (the latter issue still controversial today). In database theory circles, the original proposal of Codd (1975, 1979) is now referred to as ""Codd tables"". [ 1 ] Codd later reinforced his requirement that all RDBMSs support Null to indicate missing data in a 1985 two-part article published in Computerworld magazine. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The 1986 SQL standard basically adopted Codd's proposal after an implementation prototype in IBM System R . Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) as one of the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem ) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if they so desire; for example, to avoid well-known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features that rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column. [ 4 ] Codd indicated in his 1990 book The Relational Model for Database Management, Version 2 that the single Null mandated by the SQL standard was inadequate, and should be replaced by two separate Null-type markers to indicate why data is missing. In Codd's book, these two Null-type markers are referred to as 'A-Values' and 'I-Values', representing 'Missing But Applicable' and 'Missing But Inapplicable', respectively. [ 5 ] Codd's recommendation would have required SQL's logic system be expanded to accommodate a four-valued logic system.  Because of this additional complexity, the idea of multiple Nulls with different definitions has not gained widespread acceptance in the database practitioners' domain. It remains an active field of research though, with numerous papers still being published. Challenges [ edit ] Null has been the focus of controversy and a source of debate because of its associated three-valued logic (3VL), special requirements for its use in SQL joins , and the special handling required by aggregate functions and SQL grouping operators. Computer science professor Ron van der Meyden summarized the various issues as: ""The inconsistencies in the SQL standard mean that it is not possible to ascribe any intuitive logical semantics to the treatment of nulls in SQL."" [ 1 ] Although various proposals have been made for resolving these issues, the complexity of the alternatives has prevented their widespread adoption. Null propagation [ edit ] Arithmetic operations [ edit ] Because Null is not a data value, but a marker for an absent value, using mathematical operators on Null gives an unknown result, which is represented by Null. [ 6 ] In the following example, multiplying 10 by Null results in Null: 10  NULL -- Result is NULL This can lead to unanticipated results.  For instance, when an attempt is made to divide Null by zero, platforms may return Null instead of throwing an expected ""data exception   division by zero"". [ 6 ] Though this behavior is not defined by the ISO SQL standard many DBMS vendors treat this operation similarly. For instance, the Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL Server, and Microsoft SQL Server platforms all return a Null result for the following: NULL / 0 String concatenation [ edit ] String concatenation operations, which are common in SQL, also result in Null when one of the operands is Null. [ 7 ] The following example demonstrates the Null result returned by using Null with the SQL  string concatenation operator. 'Fish '  NULL  'Chips' -- Result is NULL This is not true for all database implementations. In an Oracle RDBMS, for example, NULL and the empty string are considered the same thing and therefore 'Fish '  NULL  'Chips' results in 'Fish Chips'. [ 8 ] Comparisons with NULL and the three-valued logic (3VL) [ edit ] Further information: Three-valued logic Since Null is not a member of any data domain , it is not considered a ""value"", but rather a marker (or placeholder) indicating the undefined value . Because of this, comparisons with Null can never result in either True or False, but always in a third logical result, Unknown. [ 9 ] The logical result of the expression below, which compares the value 10 to Null, is Unknown: SELECT 10  NULL -- Results in Unknown However, certain operations on Null can return values if the absent value is not relevant to the outcome of the operation. Consider the following example: SELECT NULL OR TRUE -- Results in True In this case, the fact that the value on the left of OR is unknowable is irrelevant, because the outcome of the OR operation would be True regardless of the value on the left. SQL implements three logical results, so SQL implementations must provide for a specialized three-valued logic (3VL) .  The rules governing SQL three-valued logic are shown in the tables below ( p and q represent logical states)"" [ 10 ] The truth tables SQL uses for AND, OR, and NOT correspond to a common fragment of the Kleene and ukasiewicz three-valued logic (which differ in their definition of implication, however, SQL defines no such operation). [ 11 ] p q p OR q p AND q p  q True True True True True True False True False False True Unknown True Unknown Unknown False True True False False False False False False True False Unknown Unknown False Unknown Unknown True True Unknown Unknown Unknown False Unknown False Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown p NOT p True False False True Unknown Unknown Effect of Unknown in WHERE clauses [ edit ] SQL three-valued logic is encountered in Data Manipulation Language (DML) in comparison predicates of DML statements and queries. The WHERE clause causes the DML statement to act on only those rows for which the predicate evaluates to True.  Rows for which the predicate evaluates to either False or Unknown are not acted on by INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE DML statements, and are discarded by SELECT queries. Interpreting Unknown and False as the same logical result is a common error encountered while dealing with Nulls. [ 10 ] The following simple example demonstrates this fallacy: SELECT  FROM t WHERE i  NULL ; The example query above logically always returns zero rows because the comparison of the i column with Null always returns Unknown, even for those rows where i is Null.  The Unknown result causes the SELECT statement to summarily discard every row. (However, in practice, some SQL tools will retrieve rows using a comparison with Null.) Null-specific and 3VL-specific comparison predicates [ edit ] Basic SQL comparison operators always return Unknown when comparing anything with Null, so the SQL standard provides for two special Null-specific comparison predicates. The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates (which use a postfix syntax) test whether data is, or is not, Null. [ 12 ] The SQL standard contains the optional feature F571 ""Truth value tests"" that introduces three additional logical unary operators (six in fact, if we count their negation, which is part of their syntax), also using postfix notation. They have the following truth tables: [ 13 ] p p IS TRUE p IS NOT TRUE p IS FALSE p IS NOT FALSE p IS UNKNOWN p IS NOT UNKNOWN True True False False True False True False False True True False False True Unknown False True False True True False The F571 feature is orthogonal to the presence of the Boolean datatype in SQL (discussed later in this article) and, despite syntactic similarities, F571 does not introduce Boolean or three-valued literals in the language. The F571 feature was actually present in SQL92 , [ 14 ] well before the Boolean datatype was introduced to the standard in 1999. The F571 feature is implemented by few systems however; PostgreSQL is one of those implementing it. The addition of IS UNKNOWN to the other operators of SQL's three-valued logic makes the SQL three-valued logic functionally complete , [ 15 ] meaning its logical operators can express (in combination) any conceivable three-valued logical function. On systems that don't support the F571 feature, it is possible to emulate IS UNKNOWN p by going over every argument that could make the expression p Unknown and test those arguments with IS NULL or other NULL-specific functions, although this may be more cumbersome. Law of the excluded fourth (in WHERE clauses) [ edit ] In SQL's three-valued logic the law of the excluded middle , p OR NOT p , no longer evaluates to true for all p . More precisely, in SQL's three-valued logic p OR NOT p is unknown precisely when p is unknown and true otherwise. Because direct comparisons with Null result in the unknown logical value, the following query SELECT  FROM stuff WHERE ( x  10 ) OR NOT ( x  10 ); is not equivalent in SQL with SELECT  FROM stuff ; if the column x contains any Nulls; in that case, the second query would return some rows the first one does not return, namely all those in which x is Null. In classical two-valued logic, the law of the excluded middle would allow the simplification of the WHERE clause predicate, in fact its elimination. Attempting to apply the law of the excluded middle to SQL's 3VL is effectively a false dichotomy . The second query is actually equivalent with: SELECT  FROM stuff ; -- is (because of 3VL) equivalent to: SELECT  FROM stuff WHERE ( x  10 ) OR NOT ( x  10 ) OR x IS NULL ; Thus, to correctly simplify the first statement in SQL requires that we return all rows in which x is not null. SELECT  FROM stuff WHERE x IS NOT NULL ; In view of the above, observe that for SQL's WHERE clause a tautology similar to the law of excluded middle can be written. Assuming the IS UNKNOWN operator is present, p OR (NOT p ) OR ( p IS UNKNOWN) is true for every predicate p . Among logicians, this is called law of excluded fourth . There are some SQL expressions in which it is less obvious where the false dilemma occurs, for example: SELECT 'ok' WHERE 1 NOT IN ( SELECT CAST ( NULL AS INTEGER )) UNION SELECT 'ok' WHERE 1 IN ( SELECT CAST ( NULL AS INTEGER )); produces no rows because IN translates to an iterated version of equality over the argument set and 1NULL is Unknown, just as a 1NULL is Unknown. (The CAST in this example is needed only in some SQL implementations like PostgreSQL, which would reject it with a type checking error otherwise. In many systems plain SELECT NULL works in the subquery.) The missing case above is of course: SELECT 'ok' WHERE ( 1 IN ( SELECT CAST ( NULL AS INTEGER ))) IS UNKNOWN ; Effect of Null and Unknown in other constructs [ edit ] Joins [ edit ] Joins evaluate using the same comparison rules as for WHERE clauses. Therefore, care must be taken when using nullable columns in SQL join criteria. In particular a table containing any nulls is not equal with a natural self-join of itself, meaning that whereas R  R  R displaystyle Rbowtie RR is true for any relation R in relational algebra , a SQL self-join will exclude all rows having a Null anywhere. [ 16 ] An example of this behavior is given in the section analyzing the missing-value semantics of Nulls. The SQL COALESCE function or CASE expressions can be used to ""simulate"" Null equality in join criteria, and the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates can be used in the join criteria as well. The following predicate tests for equality of the values A and B and treats Nulls as being equal. ( A  B ) OR ( A IS NULL AND B IS NULL ) CASE expressions [ edit ] SQL provides two flavours of conditional expressions . One is called ""simple CASE"" and operates like a switch statement . The other is called a ""searched CASE"" in the standard, and operates like an if...elseif . The simple CASE expressions use implicit equality comparisons which operate under the same rules as the DML WHERE clause rules for Null. Thus, a simple CASE expression cannot check for the existence of Null directly. A check for Null in a simple CASE expression always results in Unknown, as in the following: SELECT CASE i WHEN NULL THEN 'Is Null' -- This will never be returned WHEN 0 THEN 'Is Zero' -- This will be returned when i  0 WHEN 1 THEN 'Is One' -- This will be returned when i  1 END FROM t ; Because the expression i  NULL evaluates to Unknown no matter what value column i contains (even if it contains Null), the string 'Is Null' will never be returned. On the other hand, a ""searched"" CASE expression can use predicates like IS NULL and IS NOT NULL in its conditions. The following example shows how to use a searched CASE expression to properly check for Null: SELECT CASE WHEN i IS NULL THEN 'Null Result' -- This will be returned when i is NULL WHEN i  0 THEN 'Zero' -- This will be returned when i  0 WHEN i  1 THEN 'One' -- This will be returned when i  1 END FROM t ; In the searched CASE expression, the string 'Null Result' is returned for all rows in which i is Null. Oracle's dialect of SQL provides a built-in function DECODE which can be used instead of the simple CASE expressions and considers two nulls equal. SELECT DECODE ( i , NULL , 'Null Result' , 0 , 'Zero' , 1 , 'One' ) FROM t ; Finally, all these constructs return a NULL if no match is found; they have a default ELSE NULL clause. IF statements in procedural extensions [ edit ] SQL/PSM (SQL Persistent Stored Modules) defines procedural extensions for SQL, such as the IF statement.  However, the major SQL vendors have historically included their own proprietary procedural extensions. Procedural extensions for looping and comparisons operate under Null comparison rules similar to those for DML statements and queries. The following code fragment, in ISO SQL standard format, demonstrates the use of Null 3VL in an IF statement. IF i  NULL THEN SELECT 'Result is True' ELSEIF NOT ( i  NULL ) THEN SELECT 'Result is False' ELSE SELECT 'Result is Unknown' ; The IF statement performs actions only for those comparisons that evaluate to True.  For statements that evaluate to False or Unknown, the IF statement passes control to the ELSEIF clause, and finally to the ELSE clause. The result of the code above will always be the message 'Result is Unknown' since the comparisons with Null always evaluate to Unknown. Analysis of SQL Null missing-value semantics [ edit ] The groundbreaking work of T. Imieliski and W. Lipski Jr. (1984) [ 17 ] provided a framework in which to evaluate the intended semantics of various proposals to implement missing-value semantics, that is referred to as Imieliski-Lipski Algebras . This section roughly follows chapter 19 of the ""Alice"" textbook. [ 18 ] A similar presentation appears in the review of Ron van der Meyden, 10.4. [ 1 ] In selections and projections: weak representation [ edit ] Constructs representing missing information, such as Codd tables, are actually intended to represent a set of relations, one for each possible instantiation of their parameters; in the case of Codd tables, this means replacement of Nulls with some concrete value. For example, Emp Name Age George 43 Harriet NULL Charles 56 EmpH22 Name Age George 43 Harriet 22 Charles 56 EmpH37 Name Age George 43 Harriet 37 Charles 56 The Codd table Emp may represent the relation EmpH22 or EmpH37 , as pictured. A construct (such as a Codd table) is said to be a strong representation system (of missing information) if any answer to a query made on the construct can be particularized to obtain an answer for any corresponding query on the relations it represents, which are seen as models of the construct. More precisely, if q is a query formula in the relational algebra (of ""pure"" relations) and if q is its lifting to a construct intended to represent missing information, a strong representation has the property that for any query q and (table) construct T , q lifts all the answers to the construct, i.e.: M o d e l s  ( q  ( T ) )   q ( R )  R  M o d e l s  ( T )  displaystyle mathop mathrm Models  (bar q(T))q(R),Rin mathop mathrm Models  (T) (The above has to hold for queries taking any number of tables as arguments, but the restriction to one table suffices for this discussion.) Clearly Codd tables do not have this strong property if selections and projections are considered as part of the query language. For example, all the answers to SELECT  FROM Emp WHERE Age  22 ; should include the possibility that a relation like EmpH22 may exist. However, Codd tables cannot represent the disjunction ""result with possibly 0 or 1 rows"". A device, mostly of theoretical interest, called conditional table (or c-table) can however represent such an answer: Result Name Age condition Harriet  1  1  22 where the condition column is interpreted as the row doesn't exist if the condition is false. It turns out that because the formulas in the condition column of a c-table can be arbitrary propositional logic formulas, an algorithm for the problem whether a c-table represents some concrete relation has a co-NP-complete complexity, thus is of little practical worth. A weaker notion of representation is therefore desirable. Imielinski and Lipski introduced the notion of weak representation , which essentially allows (lifted) queries over a construct to return a representation only for sure information, i.e. if it's valid for all "" possible world "" instantiations (models) of the construct. Concretely, a construct is a weak representation system if  M o d e l s  ( q  ( T ) )    q ( R )  R  M o d e l s  ( T )  displaystyle bigcap mathop mathrm Models  (bar q(T))bigcap q(R),Rin mathop mathrm Models  (T) The right-hand side of the above equation is the sure information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls in the database. In the example we considered above, it's easy to see that the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age  22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section. If joins or unions are considered: not even weak representation [ edit ] Consider the following query over the same Codd table Emp from the previous section: SELECT Name FROM Emp WHERE Age  22 UNION SELECT Name FROM Emp WHERE Age  22 ; Whatever concrete value one would choose for the NULL age of Harriet, the above query will return the full column of names of any model of Emp , but when the (lifted) query is run on Emp itself, Harriet will always be missing, i.e. we have: Query result on Emp : Name George Charles Query result on any model of Emp : Name George Harriet Charles Thus when unions are added to the query language, Codd tables are not even a weak representation system of missing information, meaning that queries over them don't even report all sure information. It's important to note here that semantics of UNION on Nulls, which are discussed in a later section, did not even come into play in this query. The ""forgetful"" nature of the two sub-queries was all that it took to guarantee that some sure information went unreported when the above query was run on the Codd table Emp. For natural joins , the example needed to show that sure information may be unreported by some query is slightly more complicated. Consider the table J F1 F2 F3 11 NULL 13 21 NULL 23 31 32 33 and the query SELECT F1 , F3 FROM ( SELECT F1 , F2 FROM J ) AS F12 NATURAL JOIN ( SELECT F2 , F3 FROM J ) AS F23 ; Query result on J: F1 F3 31 33 Query result on any model of J: F1 F3 11 13 21 23 31 33 The intuition for what happens above is that the Codd tables representing the projections in the subqueries lose track of the fact that the Nulls in the columns F12.F2 and F23.F2 are actually copies of the originals in the table J. This observation suggests that a relatively simple improvement of Codd tables (which works correctly for this example) would be to use Skolem constants (meaning Skolem functions which are also constant functions ), say  12 and  22 instead of a single NULL symbol. Such an approach, called v-tables or Naive tables, is computationally less expensive that the c-tables discussed above. However, it is still not a complete solution for incomplete information in the sense that v-tables are only a weak representation for queries not using any negations in selection (and not using any set difference either). The first example considered in this section is using a negative selection clause, WHERE Age  22 , so it is also an example where v-tables queries would not report sure information. Check constraints and foreign keys [ edit ] The primary place in which SQL three-valued logic intersects with SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) is in the form of check constraints . A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML WHERE clause. While a DML WHERE clause must evaluate to True for a row, a check constraint must not evaluate to False. (From a logic perspective, the designated values are True and Unknown.) This means that a check constraint will succeed if the result of the check is either True or Unknown.  The following example table with a check constraint will prohibit any integer values from being inserted into column i , but will allow Null to be inserted since the result of the check will always evaluate to Unknown for Nulls. [ 19 ] CREATE TABLE t ( i INTEGER , CONSTRAINT ck_i CHECK ( i  0 AND i  0 AND i  0 ) ); Because of the change in designated values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK ( p OR NOT p ) always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to be interpreted as existing but unknown values, some pathological CHECKs like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non-null value. In order to constrain a column to reject Nulls, the NOT NULL constraint can be applied, as shown in the example below. The NOT NULL constraint is semantically equivalent to a check constraint with an IS NOT NULL predicate. CREATE TABLE t ( i INTEGER NOT NULL ); By default check constraints against foreign keys succeed if any of the fields in such keys are Null. For example, the table CREATE TABLE Books ( title VARCHAR ( 100 ), author_last VARCHAR ( 20 ), author_first VARCHAR ( 20 ), FOREIGN KEY ( author_last , author_first ) REFERENCES Authors ( last_name , first_name )); would allow insertion of rows where author_last or author_first are NULL irrespective of how the table Authors is defined or what it contains. More precisely, a null in any of these fields would allow any value in the other one, even on that is not found in Authors table. For example, if Authors contained only ('Doe', 'John') , then ('Smith', NULL) would satisfy the foreign key constraint. SQL-92 added two extra options for narrowing down the matches in such cases. If MATCH PARTIAL is added after the REFERENCES declaration then any non-null must match the foreign key, e.g. ('Doe', NULL) would still match, but ('Smith', NULL) would not. Finally, if MATCH FULL is added then ('Doe', NULL) would not match the constraint either, but (NULL, NULL) would still match it. Outer joins [ edit ] Example SQL outer join query with Null placeholders in the result set.  The Null markers are represented by the word NULL in place of data in the results.  Results are from Microsoft SQL Server , as shown in SQL Server Management Studio. SQL outer joins , including left outer joins, right outer joins, and full outer joins, automatically produce Nulls as placeholders for missing values in related tables.  For left outer joins, for instance, Nulls are produced in place of rows missing from the table appearing on the right-hand side of the LEFT OUTER JOIN operator.  The following simple example uses two tables to demonstrate Null placeholder production in a left outer join. The first table ( Employee ) contains employee ID numbers and names, while the second table ( PhoneNumber ) contains related employee ID numbers and phone numbers , as shown below. Employee ID LastName FirstName 1 Johnson Joe 2 Lewis Larry 3 Thompson Thomas 4 Patterson Patricia PhoneNumber ID Number 1 555-2323 3 555-9876 The following sample SQL query performs a left outer join on these two tables. SELECT e . ID , e . LastName , e . FirstName , pn . Number FROM Employee e LEFT OUTER JOIN PhoneNumber pn ON e . ID  pn . ID ; The result set generated by this query demonstrates how SQL uses Null as a placeholder for values missing from the right-hand ( PhoneNumber ) table, as shown below. Query result ID LastName FirstName Number 1 Johnson Joe 555-2323 2 Lewis Larry NULL 3 Thompson Thomas 555-9876 4 Patterson Patricia NULL Aggregate functions [ edit ] SQL defines aggregate functions to simplify server-side aggregate calculations on data. Except for the COUNT() function, all aggregate functions perform a Null-elimination step, so that Nulls are not included in the final result of the calculation. [ 20 ] Note that the elimination of Null is not equivalent to replacing Null with zero. For example, in the following table, AVG(i) (the average of the values of i ) will give a different result from that of AVG(j) : i j 150 150 200 200 250 250 NULL 0 Here AVG(i) is 200 (the average of 150, 200, and 250), while AVG(j) is 150 (the average of 150, 200, 250, and 0).  A well-known side effect of this is that in SQL, AVG(z) is not equivalent with SUM(z)/COUNT() but with SUM(z)/COUNT(z) . [ 4 ] The output of an aggregate function can also be Null. Here is an example: SELECT COUNT (  ), MIN ( e . Wage ), MAX ( e . Wage ) FROM Employee e WHERE e . LastName LIKE 'Jones' ; This query will always output exactly one row, counting the number of employees whose last name contains ""Jones"", and giving the minimum and maximum wage found for those employees. However, what happens if none of the employees fit the given criteria? Calculating the minimum or maximum value of an empty set is impossible, so those results must be NULL, indicating there is no answer. This is not an Unknown value, it is a Null representing the absence of a value. The result would be: COUNT() MIN(e.Wage) MAX(e.Wage) 0 NULL NULL When two nulls are equal: grouping, sorting, and some set operations [ edit ] Because SQL:2003 defines all Null markers as being unequal to one another, a special definition was required in order to group Nulls together when performing certain operations.  SQL defines ""any two values that are equal to one another, or any two Nulls"", as ""not distinct"". [ 21 ] This definition of not distinct allows SQL to group and sort Nulls when the GROUP BY clause (or another SQL language feature that performs grouping) is used. Other SQL operations, clauses, and keywords using the ""not distinct"" definition in their treatment of Nulls include: The PARTITION BY clause of the ranking and windowing functions such as ROW_NUMBER The UNION , INTERSECT , and EXCEPT operators, which treat NULLs as the same for row comparison/elimination purposes The DISTINCT keyword used in SELECT queries The principle that Nulls are not equal to each other (but rather that the result is Unknown) is effectively violated in the SQL specification for the UNION operator, which does identify nulls with each other. [ 1 ] Consequently, some set operations in SQL, such as union and difference, may produce results not representing sure information, unlike operations involving explicit comparisons with NULL (e.g. those in a WHERE clause discussed above). In Codd's 1979 proposal (which was adopted by SQL92) this semantic inconsistency is rationalized by arguing that removal of duplicates in set operations happens ""at a lower level of detail than equality testing in the evaluation of retrieval operations."" [ 11 ] The SQL standard does not explicitly define a default sorting order for Nulls.  Instead, on conforming systems, Nulls can be sorted before or after all data values by using the NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST clauses of the ORDER BY list, respectively. Not all DBMS vendors implement this functionality, however.  Vendors who do not implement this functionality may specify different treatments for Null sorting in the DBMS. [ 19 ] Effect on index operation [ edit ] Some SQL products do not index keys containing NULLs. For instance, PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.3 did not, with the documentation for a B-tree index stating that [ 22 ] B-trees can handle equality and range queries on data that can be sorted into some ordering. In particular, the PostgreSQL query planner will consider using a B-tree index whenever an indexed column is involved in a comparison using one of these operators:      Constructs equivalent to combinations of these operators, such as BETWEEN and IN, can also be implemented with a B-tree index search. (But note that IS NULL is not equivalent to  and is not indexable.) In cases where the index enforces uniqueness, NULLs are excluded from the index and uniqueness is not enforced between NULLs. Again, quoting from the PostgreSQL documentation: [ 23 ] When an index is declared unique, multiple table rows with equal indexed values will not be allowed. Nulls are not considered equal. A multicolumn unique index will only reject cases where all of the indexed columns are equal in two rows. This is consistent with the SQL:2003 -defined behavior of scalar Null comparisons. Another method of indexing Nulls involves handling them as not distinct in accordance with the SQL:2003-defined behavior. For example, Microsoft SQL Server documentation states the following: [ 24 ] For indexing purposes, NULLs compare as equal. Therefore, a unique index, or UNIQUE constraint, cannot be created if the keys are NULL in more than one row. Select columns that are defined as NOT NULL when columns for a unique index or unique constraint are chosen. Both of these indexing strategies are consistent with the SQL:2003-defined behavior of Nulls. Because indexing methodologies are not explicitly defined by the SQL:2003 standard, indexing strategies for Nulls are left entirely to the vendors to design and implement. Null-handling functions [ edit ] SQL defines two functions to explicitly handle Nulls: NULLIF and COALESCE . Both functions are abbreviations for searched CASE expressions . [ 25 ] NULLIF [ edit ] The NULLIF function accepts two parameters.  If the first parameter is equal to the second parameter, NULLIF returns Null.  Otherwise, the value of the first parameter is returned. NULLIF ( value1 , value2 ) Thus, NULLIF is an abbreviation for the following CASE expression: CASE WHEN value1  value2 THEN NULL ELSE value1 END COALESCE [ edit ] The COALESCE function accepts a list of parameters, returning the first non-Null value from the list: COALESCE ( value1 , value2 , value3 , ...) COALESCE is defined as shorthand for the following SQL CASE expression: CASE WHEN value1 IS NOT NULL THEN value1 WHEN value2 IS NOT NULL THEN value2 WHEN value3 IS NOT NULL THEN value3 ... END Some SQL DBMSs implement vendor-specific functions similar to COALESCE .  Some systems (e.g. Transact-SQL ) implement an ISNULL function, or other similar functions that are functionally similar to COALESCE .  (See Is functions for more on the IS functions in Transact-SQL.) NVL [ edit ] ""NVL"" redirects here. For other uses, see NVL (disambiguation) . The Oracle NVL function accepts two parameters.  It returns the first non-NULL parameter or NULL if all parameters are NULL. A COALESCE expression can be converted into an equivalent NVL expression thus: COALESCE ( val1 , ... , val  n  ) turns into: NVL ( val1 , NVL ( val2 , NVL ( val3 ,  , NVL ( val  n - 1  , val  n  )  ))) A use case of this function is to replace in an expression a NULL by a value like in NVL(SALARY, 0) which says, 'if SALARY is NULL, replace it with the value 0'. There is, however, one notable exception. In most implementations, COALESCE evaluates its parameters until it reaches the first non-NULL one, while NVL evaluates all of its parameters. This is important for several reasons. A parameter after the first non-NULL parameter could be a function, which could either be computationally expensive, invalid, or could create unexpected side effects. Data typing of Null and Unknown [ edit ] See also: Option type and Nullable type The NULL literal is untyped in SQL, meaning that it is not designated as an integer, character, or any other specific data type . [ 26 ] Because of this, it is sometimes mandatory (or desirable) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type. For instance, if overloaded functions are supported by the RDBMS, SQL might not be able to automatically resolve to the correct function without knowing the data types of all parameters, including those for which Null is passed. Conversion from the NULL literal to a Null of a specific type is possible using the CAST introduced in SQL-92 . For example: CAST ( NULL AS INTEGER ) represents an absent value of type INTEGER. The actual typing of Unknown (distinct or not from NULL itself) varies between SQL implementations. For example, the following SELECT 'ok' WHERE ( NULL  1 ) IS NULL ; parses and executes successfully in some environments (e.g. SQLite or PostgreSQL ) which unify a NULL Boolean with Unknown but fails to parse in others (e.g. in SQL Server Compact ). MySQL behaves similarly to PostgreSQL in this regard (with the minor exception that MySQL regards TRUE and FALSE as no different from the ordinary integers 1 and 0). PostgreSQL additionally implements a IS UNKNOWN predicate, which can be used to test whether a three-value logical outcome is Unknown, although this is merely syntactic sugar. BOOLEAN data type [ edit ] The ISO SQL:1999 standard introduced the BOOLEAN data type to SQL, however it's still just an optional, non-core feature, coded T031. [ 27 ] When restricted by a NOT NULL constraint, the SQL BOOLEAN works like the Boolean type from other languages. Unrestricted however, the BOOLEAN datatype, despite its name, can hold the truth values TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN, all of which are defined as Boolean literals according to the standard. The standard also asserts that NULL and UNKNOWN ""may be used interchangeably to mean exactly the same thing"". [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The Boolean type has been subject of criticism, particularly because of the mandated behavior of the UNKNOWN literal, which is never equal to itself because of the identification with NULL. [ 30 ] As discussed above, in the PostgreSQL implementation of SQL , Null is used to represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors do not support the Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. [ 31 ] The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL however supports BOOLEAN variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN. [ 32 ] Controversy [ edit ] Common mistakes [ edit ] Misunderstanding of how Null works is the cause of a great number of errors in SQL code, both in ISO standard SQL statements and in the specific SQL dialects supported by real-world database management systems. These mistakes are usually the result of confusion between Null and either 0 (zero) or an empty string (a string value with a length of zero, represented in SQL as '' ).  Null is defined by the SQL standard as different from both an empty string and the numerical value 0 , however. While Null indicates the absence of any value, the empty string and numerical zero both represent actual values. A classic error is the attempt to use the equals operator  in combination with the keyword NULL to find rows with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid syntax and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the syntax and evaluate such expressions to UNKNOWN . The consequence is that no rows are found   regardless of whether rows with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve rows with Nulls is the use of the predicate IS NULL instead of  NULL . SELECT  FROM sometable WHERE num  NULL ; -- Should be ""WHERE num IS NULL"" In a related, but more subtle example, a WHERE clause or conditional statement might compare a column's value with a constant.  It is often incorrectly assumed that a missing value would be ""less than"" or ""not equal to"" a constant if that field contains Null, but, in fact, such expressions return Unknown. An example is below: SELECT  FROM sometable WHERE num  1 ; -- Rows where num is NULL will not be returned, -- contrary to many users' expectations. These confusions arise because the Law of Identity is restricted in SQL's logic. When dealing with equality comparisons using the NULL literal or the UNKNOWN truth-value, SQL will always return UNKNOWN as the result of the expression. This is a partial equivalence relation and makes SQL an example of a Non-Reflexive logic . [ 33 ] Similarly, Nulls are often confused with empty strings.  Consider the LENGTH function, which returns the number of characters in a string.  When a Null is passed into this function, the function returns Null.  This can lead to unexpected results, if users are not well versed in 3-value logic. An example is below: SELECT  FROM sometable WHERE LENGTH ( string )  20 ; -- Rows where string is NULL will not be returned. This is complicated by the fact that in some database interface programs (or even database implementations like Oracle's), NULL is reported as an empty string, and empty strings may be incorrectly stored as NULL. Criticisms [ edit ] The ISO SQL implementation of Null is the subject of criticism, debate and calls for change.  In The Relational Model for Database Management: Version 2 , Codd suggested that the SQL implementation of Null was flawed and should be replaced by two distinct Null-type markers.  The markers he proposed were to stand for ""Missing but Applicable"" and ""Missing but Inapplicable"" , known as A-values and I-values , respectively.  Codd's recommendation, if accepted, would have required the implementation of a four-valued logic in SQL. [ 5 ] Others have suggested adding additional Null-type markers to Codd's recommendation to indicate even more reasons that a data value might be ""Missing"", increasing the complexity of SQL's logic system.  At various times, proposals have also been put forth to implement multiple user-defined Null markers in SQL.  Because of the complexity of the Null-handling and logic systems required to support multiple Null markers, none of these proposals have gained widespread acceptance. Chris Date and Hugh Darwen , authors of The Third Manifesto , have suggested that the SQL Null implementation is inherently flawed and should be eliminated altogether, [ 34 ] pointing to inconsistencies and flaws in the implementation of SQL Null-handling (particularly in aggregate functions) as proof that the entire concept of Null is flawed and should be removed from the relational model. [ 35 ] Others, like author Fabian Pascal , have stated a belief that ""how the function calculation should treat missing values is not governed by the relational model."" [ citation needed ] Closed-world assumption [ edit ] Another point of conflict concerning Nulls is that they violate the closed-world assumption model of relational databases by introducing an open-world assumption into it. [ 36 ] The closed world assumption, as it pertains to databases, states that ""Everything stated by the database, either explicitly or implicitly, is true; everything else is false."" [ 37 ] This view assumes that the knowledge of the world stored within a database is complete.  Nulls, however, operate under the open world assumption, in which some items stored in the database are considered unknown, making the database's stored knowledge of the world incomplete.

(10 answers) Closed 5 years ago . I was trying to understand how to use the WITH clause and the purpose of the WITH clause. All I understood was, the WITH clause was a replacement for normal sub-queries. Can anyone explain this to me with a small example in detail ? sql with-clause Share Improve this question Follow edited May 23, 2017 at 12:26 Community Bot 1 1 1 silver badge asked Sep 23, 2012 at 12:14 user1213167 user1213167 5 3 msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175972(vsql.105).aspx  Vikdor Commented Sep 23, 2012 at 12:17 3 are you using MYSQL? b/c it isn't supported.  Lorenz Lo Sauer Commented Sep 23, 2012 at 12:19 I put together an example how to use the WITH clause to create temporary static table. You might find this useful, since it contains some examples on how to use WITH clauses in your queries. giombetti.com/2014/02/14/  Marc Giombetti Commented Feb 14, 2014 at 12:42 3 since the OP made the post, MySQL implemented the WITH statement: dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html  Pierre Cavin Commented Aug 28, 2019 at 13:18 5 Very inappropriate to mark as duplicate in my opinion, especially given that from an entry level, no-one would ever click on the question, and secondly the answer is wildly different. And this one is more practically useful...  AER Commented Sep 19, 2019 at 7:02 Add a comment  2 Answers 2 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Trending (recent votes count more) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 352 The SQL WITH clause was introduced by Oracle in the Oracle 9i release 2 database. The SQL WITH clause allows you to give a sub-query block a name (a process also called sub-query refactoring), which can be referenced in several places within the main SQL query. The name assigned to the sub-query is treated as though it was an inline view or table. The SQL WITH clause is basically a drop-in replacement to the normal sub-query. Syntax For The SQL WITH Clause The following is the syntax of the SQL WITH clause when using a single sub-query alias. WITH alias_name AS (sql_subquery_statement) SELECT column_list FROM alias_name[,table_name] [WHERE join_condition] When using multiple sub-query aliases, the syntax is as follows. WITH alias_name_A AS (sql_subquery_statement), alias_name_B AS(sql_subquery_statement_from_alias_name_A or sql_subquery_statement ) SELECT column_list FROM alias_name_A, alias_name_B [,table_names] [WHERE join_condition] In the syntax documentation above, the occurrences of alias_name is a meaningful name you would give to the sub-query after the AS clause. Each sub-query should be separated with a comma Example for WITH statement . The rest of the queries follow the standard formats for simple and complex SQL SELECT queries.

For example, WITH employee AS (Name, ID).  Agent 0 Commented Oct 22, 2018 at 23:25 1 In MSSQL, you need to add a semicolon (;) before WITH, order wise you will get an error. it should be ;WITH blabla AS ...)  Obinna Nnenanya Commented Dec 6, 2018 at 17:59 ObinnaNnenanya In MSSQL, another approach is to have the WITH statement first, e.g. WITH x as (...) SELECT ... . Though you can/should put a semicolon after statements, and so put one before the word SELECT . But if you were trying to avoid semicolons, or looking for an approach that seems more readble, just put the WITH statement first.

ISO basic Latin alphabet Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz v t e Z , or z , is the twenty-sixth and last letter of the Latin alphabet . It is used in the modern English alphabet , in the alphabets of other Western European languages, and in others worldwide. Its usual names in English are zed ( /  z  d / ), which is most commonly used in British English, and zee ( /  z i /  ), most commonly used in North American English, [ 1 ] with an occasional archaic variant izzard ( /   z r d / ). [ 2 ] Name [ edit ] The z ebra is sometimes used as a memorization aid in English education. In most English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, the letter's name is zed / z  d / , reflecting its derivation from the Greek letter zeta (this dates to Latin, which borrowed Y and Z from Greek), but in American English its name is zee / z i / , analogous to the names for B, C, D, etc., and deriving from a late 17th-century English dialectal form. [ 3 ] Another English dialectal form is izzard /   z r d / . This dates from the mid-18th century and probably derives from Occitan izda or the French zed , whose reconstructed Latin form would be idzta , [ 2 ] perhaps a Vulgar Latin form with a prosthetic vowel. Outside of the anglosphere, its variants are still used in Hong Kong English and Cantonese . [ 4 ] Other languages spell the letter's name in a similar way: zeta in Italian , Basque , and Spanish , seta in Icelandic (no longer part of its alphabet but found in personal names), z in Portuguese , zta in Swedish , zt in Danish , zet in Dutch , Indonesian , Polish , Romanian , and Czech , Zett in German (capitalized as a noun), zett in Norwegian , zde in French , zetto (  ) in Japanese , and git in Vietnamese (not part of its alphabet ). Several languages render it as / ts / or / dz / , e.g. tseta /tset/ or more rarely tset /tset/ in Finnish (sometimes dropping the first t altogether; /set/ , or /set/ the latter of which is not very commonplace). In Standard Chinese pinyin , the name of the letter Z is pronounced [ts] , as in ""zi"", although the English zed and zee have become very common. In Esperanto the name of the letter Z is pronounced /zo/ . History [ edit ] Phoenician Zayin Western Greek Zeta Etruscan Z Latin Z Semitic [ edit ] The Semitic symbol was the seventh letter, named zayin , which meant ""weapon"" or ""sword"". It represented either the sound / z / as in English and French, or possibly more like / dz / (as in Italian zeta , zero ). Greek [ edit ] The Greek form of Z was a close copy of the Phoenician Zayin ( ), and the Greek inscriptional form remained in this shape throughout ancient times. The Greeks called it zeta , a new name made in imitation of eta () and theta (). In earlier Greek of Athens and Northwest Greece, the letter seems to have represented / dz / ; in Attic, from the 4th century BC onwards, it seems to have stood for /zd/ and / dz /  there is no consensus concerning this issue. [ 5 ] In other dialects, such as Elean and Cretan , the symbol seems to have been used for sounds resembling the English voiced and voiceless th (IPA /  / and /  / , respectively). In the common dialect ( koine ) that succeeded the older dialects,  became / z / , as it remains in modern Greek. Etruscan [ edit ] The Etruscan letter Z was derived from the Phoenician alphabet , most probably through the Greek alphabet used on the island of Ischia. In Etruscan , this letter may have represented / ts / . Latin [ edit ] The letter Z existed in more archaic versions of Latin, but at c. 300 BC , Appius Claudius Caecus , the Roman censor , removed the letter Z from the alphabet, because the appearance while pronouncing it imitated a grinning skull. [ 6 ] A more likely explanation is that the / z / sound that it probably represented had disappeared from Latin after turning into / r / due to a rhotacism process, [ 7 ] making the letter useless for spelling Latin words. [ 8 ] Whatever the case may be, Appius Claudius's distaste for the letter Z is today credited as the reason for its removal. A few centuries later, after the Roman Conquest of Greece , Z was again borrowed to spell words from the prestigious Attic dialect of Greek. Before the reintroduction of z , the sound of zeta was written s at the beginning of words and ss in the middle of words, as in sna for  ""belt"" and trapessita for  ""banker"". In some inscriptions, z represented a Vulgar Latin sound, likely an affricate , formed by the merging of the reflexes of Classical Latin / j / , /dj/ and /gj/ : [ example needed ] for example, zanuariu for ianuariu ""January"", ziaconus for diaconus ""deacon"", and oze for hodie ""today"". [ 9 ] Likewise, /di/ sometimes replaced / z / in words like baptidiare for baptizare ""to baptize"". In modern Italian, z represents / ts / or / dz / , whereas the reflexes of ianuarius and hodie are written with the letter g (representing /d/ when before i and e ): gennaio , oggi . In other languages, such as Spanish , further evolution of the sound occurred. Old English [ edit ] Old English used S alone for both the unvoiced and the voiced sibilant . The Latin sound imported through French was new and was not written with Z but with G or I . The successive changes can be seen in the doublet forms jealous and zealous . Both of these come from a late Latin zelosus , derived from the imported Greek  zlos . The earlier form is jealous ; its initial sound is the [ d ] , which developed to Modern French [  ] . John Wycliffe wrote the word as gelows or ielous . Z at the end of a word was pronounced ts , as in English assets , from Old French asez ""enough"" ( Modern French assez ), from Vulgar Latin ad satis (""to sufficiency""). [ 10 ] Last letter of the alphabet [ edit ] In earlier times, the English alphabets used by children terminated not with Z but with  or related typographic symbols. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Some Latin based alphabets have extra letters on the end of the alphabet. The last letter for the Icelandic , Finnish and Swedish alphabets is  , while it is  for Danish and Norwegian . The German alphabet ends with Z , as the umlauts ( / , / , and / ) and the letter  ( Eszett or scharfes S ) are regarded respectively as modifications of the vowels a/o/u and as a (standardized) variant spelling of ss , not as independent letters, so they come after the unmodified letters in the alphabetical order. [ citation needed ] Typographic variants [ edit ] The variant with a stroke  and the lower-case tailed Z  , though distinct characters, can also be considered to be allographs of Z / z . Tailed Z (German geschwnztes Z , also Z mit Unterschlinge ) originated in the medieval Gothic minuscules and the Early Modern Blackletter typefaces. In some Antiqua typefaces, this letter is present as a standalone letter or in ligatures. Ligated with long s (), it is part of the origin of the Eszett () in the German alphabet . The character came to be indistinguishable from the yogh () in Middle English writing, leading to the apparently anomalous pronunciation of the surname Menzies .

It represents /  / in words like seizure . More often, this sound appears as su or si in words such as measure , decision , etc. In all these words, /  / developed from earlier / zj / by yod -coalescence . Few words in the Basic English vocabulary begin or end with z , though it occurs within other words. It is the least frequently used letter in written English , [ 13 ] with a frequency of about 0.08 in words. z is more common in the Oxford spelling of British English than in standard British English , as this variant prefers the more etymologically 'correct' -ize endings, which are closer to Greek , to -ise endings, which are closer to French ; however, -yse is preferred over -yze in Oxford spelling, as it is closer to the original Greek roots of words like analyse . The most common variety of English it is used in is American English , which prefers both the -ize and -yze endings. One native Germanic English word that contains 'z', freeze (past froze , participle frozen ) came to be spelled that way by convention, even though it could have been spelled with 's' (as with choose , chose and chosen ). z is used in writing to represent the act of sleeping (often using multiple z's, like zzzz ), as an onomatopoeia for the sound of closed-mouth human snoring . [ 14 ] Other languages [ edit ] z stands for a voiced alveolar or voiced dental sibilant / z / , in Albanian , Breton , Czech , Dutch , French , Hungarian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Romanian , Serbo-Croatian , and Slovak . It stands for / ts / in Chinese pinyin and Jyutping , Finnish (occurs in loanwords only), and German , and is likewise expressed /ts/ in Old Norse . In Italian , it represents two phonemes, / ts / and / dz / . In Portuguese , it stands for / z / in most cases, but also for / s / or /  / (depending on the regional variant) at the end of syllables. In Basque, it represents the sound / s / . Castilian Spanish uses the letter to represent /  / (as English th in thing ), though in other dialects ( Latin American , Andalusian ) this sound has merged with / s / . Before voiced consonants, the sound is voiced to [  ] or [ z ] , sometimes debbucalized to [  ] (as in the surname Guzmn [uman] , [uzman] or [uman] ). This is the only context in which z can represent a voiced sibilant [ z ] in Spanish, though s also represents [ z ] (or [  ] , depending on the dialect) in this environment. In Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, z usually stands for the sound /s/ and thus shares the value of s ; it normally occurs only in loanwords that are spelt with z in the source languages. The letter z on its own represents / z / in Polish . It is also used in four of the seven officially recognized digraphs: cz ( / t / ), dz ( / dz / or / ts / ), rz ( /  / or /  / , sometimes it represents a sequence /rz/ ) and sz ( /  / ), and is the most frequently used of the consonants in that language. (Other Slavic languages avoid digraphs and mark the corresponding phonemes with the hek (caron) diacritic:  ,  ,  ,  ; this system has its origin in Czech orthography of the Hussite period.) z can also appear with diacritical marks, namely  and  , which are used to represent the sounds /  / and /  / . They also appear in the digraphs d ( / d / or / t / ) and d ( / d / or / t / ). Hungarian uses z in the digraphs sz (expressing / s / , as opposed to the value of s , which is  ), and zs (expressing  ). The letter z on its own represents / z / . In Modern Scots , z usually represents / z / , but is also used in place of the obsolete letter  ( yogh ), which represents / g / and / j / . Whilst there are a few common nouns which use z in this manner, such as brulzie (pronounced 'brulgey' meaning broil), z as a yogh substitute is more common in people's names and placenames. Often the names are pronounced to follow the apparent English spelling, so Mackenzie is commonly pronounced with / z / . Menzies, however, retains the pronunciation of 'Mingus'. Among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet, z usually stands for [z] , such as in Azerbaijani , Igbo , Indonesian , Shona , Swahili , Tatar , Turkish , and Zulu . z represents [ dz ] in Northern Sami and Inari Sami . In Turkmen , z represents [  ] . In the Nihon-shiki , Kunrei-shiki , and Hepburn romanisations of Japanese , z stands for a phoneme whose allophones include [ z ] and [ dz ] (see Yotsugana ). Additionally, in the Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki systems, z is used to represent that same phoneme before / i / , where it's pronounced [ d   ] . In the Jyutping romanization of Cantonese , z represents / ts / . Other romanizations use either j , ch , or ts . Other systems [ edit ] In the International Phonetic Alphabet , z represents the voiced alveolar sibilant . The graphical variant    was adopted as the sign for the voiced postalveolar fricative . Other uses [ edit ] Main article: Z (disambiguation) In mathematics , U2124  DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Z is used to denote the set of integers . Originally, Z displaystyle mathbb Z  was just a handwritten version of the bold capital Z used in printing but, over time, it has come to be used more frequently in printed works too. The variable z is also commonly used to represent a complex number . In geometry, z is used to denote the third axis in Cartesian coordinates when representing 3-dimensional space. In chemistry , the letter Z is used to denote the atomic number of an element (number of protons), such as Z 3 for lithium . In electrical engineering, Z is used to denote electrical impedance . In astronomy , z is a dimensionless quantity representing redshift . In nuclear physics , Z denotes the atomic number and Z 0 denotes a Z boson . In computer programming , Z is the abbreviation for the zero flag . In Japan, the Z flag is a symbol in the national myth, representing the Battle of Tsushima . Z has been used by the Russian Armed Forces as an identifying symbol on its military vehicles , during Russia's invasion of Ukraine . Russian civilians have used the symbol to express support for the invasion.

[Middle English, variant of an , an ; see an 1 .] Usage Note: In writing, the form a is used before a word beginning with a consonant sound, regardless of its spelling ( a frog, a university, a euphemism ). The form an is used before a word beginning with a vowel sound ( an orange, an hour ).  An was once a common variant before words beginning with h in which the first syllable was unstressed; thus 18th-century authors wrote either a historical or an historical but a history, not an history. This usage made sense in that people often did not pronounce the initial h in words such as historical and heroic, but by the late 19th century educated speakers usually gave their initial h 's a huff, and the practice of writing an before such words began to die out. Nowadays it survives primarily before the word historical. One may also come across it in the phrases an hysterectomy or an hereditary trait. These usages are acceptable in formal writing. a 3 () prep. In every; to each; per: once a month; one dollar a pound. [Middle English, from Old English an , in ; see on .] a 4 () aux.v.

[Middle English; orig. preconsonantal phonetic variant of an 1 ] usage: In both spoken and written English a is used before words beginning with a consonant sound ( a book ), an before words beginning with a vowel sound ( an apple ). Words that start with vowel letters but are pronounced with the consonant sound (y) or (w) are preceded by a : a union; a European; a one-room apartment. The names of the consonant letters f, h, l, m, n, r, s, and x begin with a vowel sound and thus are preceded by an : an F in geometry; to fly an SST. The names of all other consonants and of the vowel u take a : a B in Spanish; a U-turn. Words that begin with the letter h sometimes cause confusion. When the h is not pronounced, the word is preceded by an : an hour . When h is pronounced, the word is preceded by a : a history of the Sioux; a hero sandwich. (Formerly, an was used before pronounced h: an hundred .) Usage is divided, however, with such words as historian, historical, heroic, and habitual , which begin with an unstressed syllable in which h may be weak or silent. The use of a is widespread in both speech and writing ( a historian of ancient China; a habitual criminal ), but an is also common. Hotel and unique are occasionally preceded by an , but this use is regarded as old-fashioned. a 2 (; when stressed e) prep. for or in each; for or in every; per: ten cents a ride; three times a day.

[ 2 ] This is in contrast to philia , brotherly love, or philautia , self-love, as it embraces a profound sacrificial love that transcends and persists regardless of circumstance. The verb form goes as far back as Homer , translated literally as affection , as in ""greet with affection"" and ""show affection for the dead"". [ 2 ] Other ancient authors have used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or affection for a particular activity, in contrast to eros (an affection of a sexual nature). In the New Testament , agape refers to the covenant love of God for humans, as well as the human reciprocal love for God; the term necessarily extends to the love of one's fellow human beings. [ 3 ] Some contemporary writers have sought to extend the use of agape into non-religious contexts. [ 4 ] The concept of agape has been widely examined within its Christian context. [ 5 ] It has also been considered in the contexts of other religions, [ 6 ] religious ethics , [ 7 ] and science. [ 8 ] Early uses [ edit ] There are few instances of the word agape in polytheistic Greek literature. Bauer's Lexicon mentions a sepulchral inscription, most likely to honor a polytheistic army officer held in ""high esteem"" by his country. [ 9 ] Christianity [ edit ] Fresco of a female figure holding a chalice at an early Christian Agape feast . Catacomb of Saints Marcellinus and Peter , Via Labicana , Rome . See also: First Epistle to the Corinthians  Agape The word agape received a broader usage under later Christian writers as the word that specifically denoted Christian love or charity ( 1 Corinthians 13:18 ), or even God himself. The expression ""God is love"" (     ) occurs twice in the New Testament : 1 John 4:8;16 . Agape was also used by the early Christians to refer to the self-sacrificing love of God for humanity, which they were committed to reciprocating and practicing towards God and among one another (see kenosis ). This understanding is built upon the foundational Hebrew concept of chesed , or the loving kindness of God, which is taught throughout the Old Testament . Agape has been expounded by many Christian writers in a specifically Christian context. C. S. Lewis uses agape in The Four Loves to describe what he believes is the highest variety of love known to humanity: a selfless love that is passionately committed to the well-being of others. [ 10 ] The Christian use of the term comes directly from the canonical Gospels ' accounts of the teachings of Jesus . When asked what was the great commandment , ""Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."" ( Matthew 22:3740 ) In Judaism , the first ""love the L ORD thy God"" is part of the Shema ( Deuteronomy 6:5 ), while the second ""love thy neighbour as thyself"" is a commandment from Leviticus 19:18 . The Sermon on the Mount , Carl Bloch , 1877 In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said: You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love ( agapseis ) your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, Love ( agapte ) your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you?  Matthew 5:4346 , RSV Tertullian remarks in his 2nd century defense of Christians that Christian love attracted pagan notice: ""What marks us in the eyes of our enemies is our loving kindness. 'Only look,' they say, 'look how they love one another ' "" ( Apology 39). Anglican theologian O. C. Quick writes that agape within human experience is ""a very partial and rudimentary realization,"" and that ""in its pure form it is essentially divine."" If we could imagine the love of one who loves men purely for their own sake, and not because of any need or desire of his own, purely desires their good, and yet loves them wholly, not for what at this moment they are, but for what he knows he can make of them because he made them, then we should have in our minds some true image of the love of the Father and Creator of mankind. [ 11 ] In the New Testament , the word agape is often used to describe God's love. However, other forms of the word are used in an accusatory context, such as the various forms of the verb agapa . Examples include: 2 Timothy 4:10  ""for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved [ agapsas ] this present world..."". John 12:43  ""For they loved [ gapsan ] the praise of men more than the praise of God."" John 3:19  ""And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved [ gapsan ] darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."" Karl Barth distinguishes agape from eros on the basis of its origin and depth of devotion without want. With agape , humanity does not merely express its nature, but transcends it. Agape identifies with the interests of the neighbor ""in utter independence of the question of his attractiveness"" and with no expectation of reciprocity. [ 12 ] Meal [ edit ] Main article: Agape feast The word agape is used in its plural form ( agapai ) in the New Testament to describe a meal or feast eaten by early Christians, as in Jude 1:12 and 2nd Peter 2:13 . The agape love feast is still observed by many Christian denominations today, especially among Brethren and other Plain, Anabaptist churches. For example, among the Old Order River Brethren and Old Brethren , a weekend is still set aside twice a year for special meetings, self examination and a communal Love Feast as part of their three-part Communion observance. Thelema [ edit ] In Thelema , a new religious movement developed by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, the term agape holds significant importance. Derived from Greek, agape traditionally denotes a selfless, unconditional love. In Thelemic practice, agape represents the highest form of love and is often associated with True Will and the central tenet of the religion: ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will."" Within this context, agape is seen as the expression of one's divine will and the harmony of individual purpose with universal love. It encompasses both love for others and the self, transcending personal desires and attachments. In Thelemic rituals, the term is invoked to cultivate a sense of unity, compassion, and spiritual connection among practitioners.

Learn more about our affiliate and product review process here . The AppData folder is not intended for user access. Image Credit: dowell/Moment/GettyImages Although you don't usually need to access the Application Data (AppData) folder, in some cases, you might need to use it  to transfer your Firefox user profile to another computer, for example. The problem is that the AppData folder is not intended for user access, so finding it is not as easy as finding other folders. However, you can find the AppData folder if you need to with an AppData shortcut in Windows 10, 8 and 7 or by revealing hidden folders and looking in the right place. Advertisement Understanding the AppData Folder Video of the Day Microsoft first included the AppData folder in Windows Vista, but Windows 10, 8 and 7 all have the folder, too. The folder allows each user of a machine to have different settings for their applications  browser settings or the AppData for Minecraft or other games. AppData has three subfolders: Local, LocalLow and Roaming. Advertisement We Recommend Tech Support How to Enable Special Permissions to Access Application Data Folders By Maya Austen Tech Support Where Are the Google Chrome Favorites Located and Stored? By Techwalla Team Tech Support How to Find a Temporary Folder on a Computer By Marques Williams Video of the Day The roaming folder contains most of the application data stored in the folder. Specifically, it's intended for data you need if your user profile ""roams"" from machine to machine (if it was connected to a domain, for instance). In other words, most of the settings, such as browser settings that you might need to access, are in this folder. Advertisement The other two folders are for data that is specific to one computer, with the difference being that LocalLow is only for programs that run with strict security settings. It's worth pointing out that not all programs do what you'd expect: Chrome stores the data you'd expect to find in Roaming in the Local folder, and some programs put their data in ProgramData so that it's the same for all users. Advertisement We Recommend Tech Support How to Enable Special Permissions to Access Application Data Folders By Maya Austen Tech Support Where Are the Google Chrome Favorites Located and Stored? By Techwalla Team Tech Support How to Find a Temporary Folder on a Computer By Marques Williams AppData Shortcut in Windows 10, 8 and 7 The easiest way to access the AppData folder is to use the shortcut. In Windows 10, 8 or 7, you can search for ""appdata"" in the relevant place to be taken straight to the Roaming section of the AppData folder. In Windows 10, this place is the search bar beside the Windows icon. In Windows 8, use the Charms Bar, and in Windows 7, search at the bottom of the Start menu. Advertisement Advertisement To access the main folder, click the ""Appdata"" title in the file path at the top of the window. You can also type ""appdata"" into the file path area in any File Explorer window to go to the same place. This method is the easiest way to access the AppData for a program, but there is an alternate method if you prefer to use it. Advertisement Finding the Hidden Folder The AppData folder is hidden by default in Windows because you aren't likely to need it. However, if you make hidden folders visible, you can navigate to it like you do any folder. In Windows 10, go to the ""View"" tab of a File Explorer window and click the check box beside ""Hidden items"" in the ""Show/hide"" section. In Windows 8, the process is similar, but from the ""View"" tab, go to ""Options,"" then ""View,"" and then scroll down to the ""Hidden files and folders"" section and click the radio button beside ""Show hidden files, folders and drives."" Advertisement In Windows 7, click ""Organize"" in a File Explorer window and go to the ""View"" tab. Scroll down to ""Hidden files and folders,"" and click the radio button beside ""Show hidden files, folders and drives."" After showing hidden files and folders, you can locate the AppData folder by going to C:Users[your username] and looking there. You don't need any special permissions to access. Just double-click and you're in.

By Will McGough  Share on Facebook Share on X Copy Article ThinkStock  ThinkStock Share on Facebook Share on X Share on Reddit Copy Article It happened to me just this morning, when I was fiddling with my closet doors, trying to get them back on their tracks so they would slide correctly. As one door fell off and slammed into the other, my response was automatic. Aye yai yai, these doors! I caught myself upon uttering the phrase. What the hell does that mean, anyway? And where does it come from? Its amazing how often we use phrases out of habit and inferred meaning rather than an understanding of what were actually saying. While many cultures have similar exclamations (such as the Chinese aiyo ), the most likely path the saying took into the English language is from our nearby neighbors in Mexico. The Spanish word ay!  translates to the exclamation of oh! in English, and thus any repetition of the word, such as ay ay ay, would infer a sense of dismay, confusion, or frustration. There are several ways the phrase is commonly spelled in the English language, such as aye yi yi, ai yai yai and ay yai yai, but there is no formal acknowledgement about which is correct given its slang nature. Nor is it clear how, when, or why the ay changed into yai and yi in spelling and pronunciation, but weve seen many uses of this phrase throughout pop culture, all of which obviously have some impact on how the common man uses and spells the phrase. It appears in a number of Spanish/Mexican songs, and this writer remembers hearing it as a kid from the Power Ranger character Alpha 5 , who consistently said ay yi yi during times of distress. So the bad news is that while its widely accepted that the phrase crossed the border from Mexico, the rest of the details are unfortunately rather vague and up for debate. The good news is that it means you can feel free to spell it however you want.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet . Introduction Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is the generic name for six compounds (vitamers) with vitamin B6 activity: pyridoxine, an alcohol; pyridoxal, an aldehyde; and pyridoxamine, which contains an amino group; and their respective 5'-phosphate esters. Pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5' phosphate (PMP) are the active coenzyme forms of vitamin B6 [ 1 , 2 ]. Substantial proportions of the naturally occurring pyridoxine in fruits, vegetables, and grains exist in glycosylated forms that exhibit reduced bioavailability [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 in coenzyme forms performs a wide variety of functions in the body and is extremely versatile, with involvement in more than 100 enzyme reactions, mostly concerned with protein metabolism [ 1 ]. Both PLP and PMP are involved in amino acid metabolism, and PLP is also involved in the metabolism of one-carbon units, carbohydrates, and lipids [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 also plays a role in cognitive development through the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and in maintaining normal levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 is involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, immune function (for example, it promotes lymphocyte and interleukin-2 production), and hemoglobin formation [ 3 ]. The human body absorbs vitamin B6 in the jejunum. Phosphorylated forms of the vitamin are dephosphorylated, and the pool of free vitamin B6 is absorbed by passive diffusion [ 2 ]. Vitamin B6 concentrations can be measured directly by assessing concentrations of PLP; other vitamers; or total vitamin B6 in plasma, erythrocytes, or urine [ 1 ]. Vitamin B6 concentrations can also be measured indirectly by assessing either erythrocyte aminotransferase saturation by PLP or tryptophan metabolites. Plasma PLP is the most common measure of vitamin B6 status. PLP concentrations of more than 30 nmol/L have been traditional indicators of adequate vitamin B6 status in adults [ 3 ]. However, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) used a plasma PLP level of 20 nmol/L as the major indicator of adequacy to calculate the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for adults [ 1 , 3 ]. Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin B6 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the FNB [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (9798) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50 of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Table 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B6 [ 1 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin B6 that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B6 in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin B6 [ 1 ] Age Male Female Pregnancy Lactation Birth to 6 months 0.1 mg 0.1 mg 712 months 0.3 mg 0.3 mg 13 years 0.5 mg 0.5 mg 48 years 0.6 mg 0.6 mg 913 years 1.0 mg 1.0 mg 1418 years 1.3 mg 1.2 mg 1.9 mg 2.0 mg 1950 years 1.3 mg 1.3 mg 1.9 mg 2.0 mg 51 years 1.7 mg 1.5 mg  Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Vitamin B6 Food Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of foods [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. The richest sources of vitamin B6 include fish, beef liver and other organ meats, potatoes and other starchy vegetables, and fruit (other than citrus). In the United States, adults obtain most of their dietary vitamin B6 from fortified cereals, beef, poultry, starchy vegetables, and some noncitrus fruits [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]. About 75 of vitamin B6 from a mixed diet is bioavailable [ 1 ]. The table of selected food sources of vitamin B6 suggests many dietary sources of vitamin B6. Table 2: Vitamin B6 Content of Selected Foods [ 4 ] Food Milligrams (mg) per serving Percent DV Chickpeas, canned, 1 cup 1.1 65 Beef liver, pan fried, 3 ounces 0.9 53 Tuna, yellowfin, fresh, cooked, 3 ounces 0.9 53 Salmon, sockeye, cooked, 3 ounces 0.6 35 Chicken breast, roasted, 3 ounces 0.5 29 Breakfast cereals, fortified with 25 of the DV for vitamin B6 0.4 25 Potatoes, boiled, 1 cup 0.4 25 Turkey, meat only, roasted, 3 ounces 0.4 25 Banana, 1 medium 0.4 25 Marinara (spaghetti) sauce, ready to serve, 1 cup 0.4 25 Ground beef, patty, 85 lean, broiled, 3 ounces 0.3 18 Waffles, plain, ready to heat, toasted, 1 0.3 18 Bulgur, cooked, 1 cup 0.2 12 Cottage cheese, 1 low fat, 1 cup 0.2 12 Squash, winter, baked,  cup 0.2 12 Rice, white, long grain, enriched, cooked, 1 cup 0.1 6 Nuts, mixed, dry roasted, 1 ounce 0.1 6 Raisins, seedless,  cup 0.1 6 Onions, chopped,  cup 0.1 6 Spinach, frozen, chopped, boiled,  cup 0.1 6 Tofu, raw, firm, prepared with calcium sulfate,  cup 0.1 6 Watermelon, raw, 1 cup 0.1 6 DV  Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B6 is 1.7 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 6 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B6 content unless vitamin B6 has been added to the food. Foods providing 20 or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin B6 arranged by nutrient content and by food name . Dietary supplements Vitamin B6 is available in multivitamins, in supplements containing other B complex vitamins, and as a stand-alone supplement [ 7 ]. The most common vitamin B6 vitamer in supplements is pyridoxine (in the form of pyridoxine hydrochloride [HCl]), although some supplements contain PLP. Vitamin B6 supplements are available in oral capsules or tablets (including sublingual and chewable tablets) and liquids. Absorption of vitamin B6 from supplements is similar to that from food sources and does not differ substantially among the various forms of supplements [ 1 ]. Although the body absorbs large pharmacological doses of vitamin B6 well, it quickly eliminates most of the vitamin in the urine [ 8 ]. About 2836 of the general population uses supplements containing vitamin B6 [ 9 , 10 ]. Adults age 51 years or older and children younger than 9 are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 Intakes and Status Most children, adolescents, and adults in the United States consume the recommended amounts of vitamin B6, according to an analysis of data from the 20032004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [ 10 ]. The average vitamin B6 intake is about 1.5 mg/day in women and 2 mg/day in men [ 1 ]. However, 11 of vitamin B6 supplement users and 24 of people in the United States who do not take supplements containing vitamin B6 have low plasma PLP concentrations (less than 20 nmol/L) [ 10 ]. In the 20032004 NHANES analysis, plasma PLP concentrations were low even in some groups that took 2.02.9 mg/day, which is higher than the current RDA. Among supplement users and nonusers, plasma PLP levels were much lower in women than men, non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites, current smokers than never smokers, and people who were underweight than those of normal weight. Teenagers had the lowest vitamin B6 concentrations, followed by adults age 2144 years. However, plasma PLP levels in the elderly were not particularly low, even in those who did not use supplements. Based on these data, the authors of this analysis concluded that the current RDAs might not guarantee adequate vitamin B6 status in many population groups [ 10 ]. PLP concentrations tend to be low in people with alcohol dependence; those with obesity; and pregnant women, especially those with preeclampsia or eclampsia [ 1 ]. They are also low in people with malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 Deficiency Isolated vitamin B6 deficiency is uncommon; inadequate vitamin B6 status is usually associated with low concentrations of other B-complex vitamins, such as vitamin B12 and folic acid [ 2 ]. Vitamin B6 deficiency causes biochemical changes that become more obvious as the deficiency progresses [ 2 ]. Vitamin B6 deficiency is associated with microcytic anemia, electroencephalographic abnormalities, dermatitis with cheilosis (scaling on the lips and cracks at the corners of the mouth) and glossitis (swollen tongue), depression and confusion, and weakened immune function [ 1 , 2 ]. Individuals with borderline vitamin B6 concentrations or mild deficiency might have no deficiency signs or symptoms for months or even years. In infants, vitamin B6 deficiency causes irritability, abnormally acute hearing, and convulsive seizures [ 2 ]. End-stage renal diseases, chronic renal insufficiency, and other kidney diseases can cause vitamin B6 deficiency [ 3 ]. In addition, vitamin B6 deficiency can result from malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Certain genetic diseases, such as homocystinuria, can also cause vitamin B6 deficiency [ 2 ]. Some medications, such as antiepileptic drugs, can lead to deficiency over time. Groups at Risk of Vitamin B6 Inadequacy Frank vitamin B6 deficiencies are relatively rare in the United States but some individuals might have marginal vitamin B6 status [ 2 ]. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of vitamin B6. Individuals with impaired renal function People with poor renal function, including those with end-stage renal disease and chronic renal insufficiency, often have low vitamin B6 concentrations [ 3 ]. Plasma PLP concentrations are also low in patients receiving maintenance kidney dialysis or intermittent peritoneal dialysis, as well as those who have undergone a kidney transplant, perhaps due to increased metabolic clearance of PLP [ 11 ]. Patients with kidney disease often show clinical symptoms similar to those of people with vitamin B6 deficiency [ 11 ]. Individuals with autoimmune disorders People with rheumatoid arthritis often have low vitamin B6 concentrations, and vitamin B6 concentrations tend to decrease with increased disease severity [ 3 ]. These low vitamin B6 levels are due to the inflammation caused by the disease and, in turn, increase the inflammation associated with the disease. Although vitamin B6 supplements can normalize vitamin B6 concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, they do not suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines or decrease levels of inflammatory markers [ 3 , 12 ]. Patients with celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other malabsorptive autoimmune disorders tend to have low plasma PLP concentrations [ 3 ]. The mechanisms for this effect are not known. However, celiac disease is associated with lower pyridoxine absorption, and low PLP concentrations in inflammatory bowel disease could be due to the inflammatory response [ 3 ]. People with alcohol dependence Plasma PLP concentrations tend to be very low in people with alcohol dependence [ 1 ]. Alcohol produces acetaldehyde, which decreases net PLP formation by cells and competes with PLP in protein binding [ 1 , 3 ]. As a result, the PLP in cells might be more susceptible to hydrolysis by membrane-bound phosphatase. People with alcohol dependence might benefit from pyridoxine supplementation [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 and Health Cardiovascular disease Scientists have hypothesized that certain B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6) might reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering homocysteine levels [ 1 , 13 ]. Therefore, several clinical trials have assessed the safety and efficacy of supplemental doses of B vitamins to reduce heart disease risk. Evaluating the impact of vitamin B6 from many of these trials is challenging because these studies also included folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 (HOPE 2) trial, which included more than 5,500 adults with known cardiovascular disease, found that supplementation for 5 years with vitamin B6 (50 mg/day), vitamin B12 (1 mg/day), and folic acid (2.5 mg/day) reduced homocysteine levels and decreased stroke risk by about 25, but the study did not include a separate vitamin B6 group [ 14 ]. Moreover, most other large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that supplemental B vitamins actually reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, even though they lower homocysteine levels. For example, a randomized clinical trial in 5,442 women age 42 or older found no effect of vitamin B6 supplementation (50 mg/day) in combination with 2.5 mg folic acid and 1 mg vitamin B12 on cardiovascular disease risk [ 15 ]. Two large randomized controlled trials, the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial, did include a group that received only vitamin B6 supplements (40 mg/day). The combined analysis of data from these two trials showed no benefit of vitamin B6 supplementation, with or without folic acid (0.8 mg/day) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/day), on major cardiovascular events in 6,837 patients with ischemic heart disease [ 13 ]. In a trial of adults who had suffered a nondisabling stroke, supplementation with high or low doses of a combination of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid for 2 years had no effect on subsequent stroke incidence, cardiovascular events, or risk of death [ 16 ]. The research to date provides little evidence that supplemental amounts of vitamin B6, alone or with folic acid and vitamin B12, can help reduce the risk or severity of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Cancer Some research has associated low plasma vitamin B6 concentrations with an increased risk of certain kinds of cancer [ 3 ]. For example, a meta-analysis of prospective studies found that people with a vitamin B6 intake in the highest quintile had a 20 lower risk of colorectal cancer than those with an intake in the lowest quintile [ 17 ]. However, the small number of clinical trials completed to date has not shown that vitamin B6 supplementation can help prevent cancer or reduce its impact on mortality. For example, an analysis of data from two large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in Norway found no association between vitamin B6 supplementation and cancer incidence, mortality, or all-cause mortality [ 18 ]. Cognitive function Poor vitamin B6 status has been hypothesized to play a role in the cognitive decline that some older adults experience [ 19 ]. Several studies have demonstrated an association between vitamin B6 and brain function in the elderly. For example, an analysis of data from the Boston Normative Aging Study found associations between higher serum vitamin B6 concentrations and better memory test scores in 70 men age 5481 years [ 20 ]. However, a systematic review of 14 randomized controlled trials found insufficient evidence of an effect of vitamin B6 supplementation alone or in combination with vitamin B12 and/or folic acid on cognitive function in people with normal cognitive function, dementia, or ischemic vascular disease [ 19 ]. According to this review, most of the studies were of low quality and limited applicability. A Cochrane Review found no evidence that short-term vitamin B6 supplementation (for 512 weeks) improves cognitive function or mood in the two studies that the authors evaluated [ 21 ]. The review did find some evidence that daily vitamin B6 supplements (20 mg) can affect biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status in healthy older men, but these changes had no overall impact on cognition. More evidence is needed to determine whether vitamin B6 supplements might help prevent or treat cognitive decline in elderly people. Premenstrual syndrome Some evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplements could reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but conclusions are limited due to the poor quality of most studies [ 22 ]. A meta-analysis of nine published trials involving almost 1,000 women with PMS found that vitamin B6 is more effective in reducing PMS symptoms than placebo, but most of the studies analyzed were small and several had methodological weaknesses [ 22 ]. A more recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 94 women found that 80 mg pyridoxine taken daily over the course of three cycles was associated with statistically significant reductions in a broad range of PMS symptoms, including moodiness; irritability; forgetfulness; bloating; and, especially, anxiety [ 23 ]. The potential effectiveness of vitamin B6 in alleviating the mood-related symptoms of PMS could be due to its role as a cofactor in neurotransmitter biosynthesis [ 24 ]. Although vitamin B6 shows promise for alleviating PMS symptoms, more research is needed before drawing firm conclusions. Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy About half of all women experience nausea and vomiting in the first few months of pregnancy, and about 5080 experience nausea only [ 25 , 26 ]. Although this condition is generally known as morning sickness, it often lasts throughout the day. The condition is not life threatening and typically goes away after 1220 weeks, but its symptoms can disrupt a person's social and physical functioning. Prospective studies on vitamin B6 supplements to treat morning sickness have had mixed results. In two randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 3075 mg of oral pyridoxine per day significantly decreased nausea in pregnant women who were experiencing nausea [ 27 , 28 ]. The authors of a recent Cochrane Review of studies on interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy could not draw firm conclusions on the value of vitamin B6 to control the symptoms of morning sickness [ 26 ]. Randomized trials have shown that a combination of vitamin B6 and doxylamine (an antihistamine) is associated with a 70 reduction in nausea and vomiting in pregnant women and lower hospitalization rates for this problem [ 25 , 29 ]. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends monotherapy with 1025 mg of vitamin B6 three or four times a day to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [ 29 ]. If the patient's condition does not improve, ACOG recommends adding doxylamine. Before taking a vitamin B6 supplement, pregnant women should consult a physician because doses could approach the UL. Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin B6 High intakes of vitamin B6 from food sources have not been reported to cause adverse effects [ 1 ]. However, chronic administration of 16 g oral pyridoxine per day for 1240 months can cause severe and progressive sensory neuropathy characterized by ataxia (loss of control of bodily movements) [ 10 , 30-33 ]. Symptom severity appears to be dose dependent, and the symptoms usually stop if the patient discontinues the pyridoxine supplements as soon as the neurologic symptoms appear. Other effects of excessive vitamin B6 intakes include painful, disfiguring dermatological lesions; photosensitivity; and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and heartburn [ 1 , 2 , 30 ]. The scientific literature includes isolated case reports of congenital defects in the infants of women who took pyridoxine supplements during the first half of pregnancy [ 7 ]. However, a more recent observational study found no association between pyridoxine supplementation (mean dose 132.3  74 mg/day) in pregnant women starting at 7 weeks gestation and continuing for 9  4.2 weeks and teratogenic effects in their infants [ 34 ]. The FNB has established ULs for vitamin B6 that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) [ 1 ]. The FNB noted that although several reports show sensory neuropathy occurring at doses lower than 500 mg/day, studies in patients treated with vitamin B6 (average dose of 200 mg/day) for up to 5 years found no evidence of this effect. Based on limitations in the data on potential harms from long-term use, the FNB halved the dose used in these studies to establish a UL of 100 mg/day for adults. ULs are lower for children and adolescents based on body size. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin B6 for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin B6 [ 1 ] Age Male Female Pregnancy Lactation Birth to 6 months Not possible to establish Not possible to establish 712 months Not possible to establish Not possible to establish 13 years 30 mg 30 mg 48 years 40 mg 40 mg 913 years 60 mg 60 mg 1418 years 80 mg 80 mg 80 mg 80 mg 19 years 100 mg 100 mg 100 mg 100 mg Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of vitamin B6 for infants. In 2023, the Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) released a scientific opinion on the tolerable upper intake levels for vitamin B6 [ 35 ]. Based on systematic reviews that examined associations between vitamin B6 and peripheral neuropathy, the panel set an upper limit for vitamin B6 of 12 mg/day for all adults, including women who are pregnant or lactating, with lower amounts ranging from 2.2 to 10.7 mg/day for infants and children, depending on age. Interactions with Medications Vitamin B6 can interact with certain medications, and several types of medications might adversely affect vitamin B6 levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin B6 status with their health care providers. Cycloserine Cycloserine (Seromycin) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. In combination with pyridoxal phosphate, cycloserine increases urinary excretion of pyridoxine [ 9 ]. The urinary loss of pyridoxine might exacerbate the seizures and neurotoxicity associated with cycloserine. Pyridoxine supplements can help prevent these adverse effects. Antiepileptic medications Some antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid (Depakene, Stavzor), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol, and others), and phenytoin (Dilantin) increase the catabolism rate of vitamin B6 vitamers, resulting in low plasma PLP concentrations and hyperhomocysteinemia [ 36 , 37 ]. High homocysteine levels in antiepileptic drug users might increase the risk of epileptic seizures and systemic vascular events, including stroke, and reduce the ability to control seizures in patients with epilepsy. Furthermore, patients typically use antiepileptic drugs for years, increasing their risk of chronic vascular toxicity. Some research also indicates that pyridoxine supplementation (200 mg/day for 12120 days) can reduce serum concentrations of phenytoin and phenobarbital, possibly by increasing the drugs' metabolism [ 33 , 38 ]. Whether lower pyridoxine doses have any effect is not known [ 9 ]. Levetiracetam (Keppra) is an antiepileptic medication with behavioral side effects that include irritability, agitation, and depression [ 39-41 ]. Preliminary evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplementationat such doses as 50350 mg/day in children [ 40-42 ] and 50100 mg/day in adults [ 39 ]might reduce these side effects. Theophylline Theophylline (Aquaphyllin, Elixophyllin, Theolair, Truxophyllin, and many others) can prevent or treat shortness of breath, wheezing, and other breathing problems caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. Patients treated with theophylline often have low plasma PLP concentrations, which could contribute to the neurological and central nervous system side effects associated with theophylline, including seizures [ 9 , 33 ]. Vitamin B6 and Healthful Diets The federal government's 20202025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that ""Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy)."" For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of vitamin B6. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B6. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fish, beef, and turkey contain high amounts of vitamin B6. Beans and nuts are also sources of vitamin B6. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.

It's BIOS that's responsible for the POST and therefore makes it the very first software to run when a computer is started. The BIOS firmware is non-volatile, meaning that its settings are saved and recoverable even after power has been removed from the device. BIOS is pronounced as by-oss and is sometimes referred to as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS, or PC BIOS. However, it's also incorrectly referred to as the Basic Integrated Operating System or Built-In Operating System. What Is the BIOS Used For? Lifewire BIOS instructs the computer on how to perform basic functions such as booting and keyboard control. BIOS is also used to identify and configure the hardware in a computer such as the hard drive , floppy drive, optical drive , CPU, memory , and related equipment. How to Access BIOS The BIOS is accessed and configured through the BIOS Setup Utility. The BIOS Setup Utility is, for all practical purposes, the BIOS itself. All available options in BIOS are configurable through the BIOS Setup Utility. Unlike an operating system like Windows, which is often downloaded or obtained on a disc and needs to be installed by the user or manufacturer, BIOS comes installed from the moment the machine is manufactured. The BIOS Setup Utility is accessed in various ways depending on your computer or motherboard make and model. How to Access BIOS in Windows 11 BIOS Availability All modern computer motherboards contain BIOS software. BIOS access and configuration on PC systems are independent of any operating system because the BIOS is part of the motherboard hardware. It doesn't matter if a computer is running Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, Linux, Unix, or no operating system at allBIOS functions outside of the operating system environment and is no way dependent upon it. Popular BIOS Manufacturers The following are some of the more popular BIOS vendors: Phoenix Technologies IBM Dell BYOSOFT American Megatrends (AMI) Insyde Software Award Software, General Software, and Microid Research were BIOS manufacturers acquired by Phoenix Technologies. How to Use BIOS BIOS supports several hardware configuration options that can be changed through the setup utility. Saving these changes and restarting the computer applies the changes to the BIOS and alters the way BIOS instructs the hardware to function. Here are some common things you can do in most BIOS systems: Change the Boot Order Load BIOS Setup Defaults Flash (Update) BIOS Remove a BIOS Password Create a BIOS Password Change the Date and Time Change Floppy Drive Settings Change Hard Drive Settings Change CD/DVD/BD Drive Settings View Amount of Memory Installed Change the Boot Up NumLock Status Enable or Disable the Computer Logo Enable or Disable the Quick Power On Self Test (POST) Enable or Disable the CPU Internal Cache Enable or Disable the Caching of BIOS Change CPU Settings Change Memory Settings Change System Voltages Enable or Disable RAID Enable or Disable Onboard USB Enable or Disable Onboard IEEE1394 Enable or Disable Onboard Audio Enable or Disable Onboard Floppy Controller Enable or Disable Onboard Serial/Parallel Ports Enable or Disable ACPI Change the ACPI Suspend Type Change the Power Button Function Change Power-on Settings Change Which Display is Initialized First on Multi-Display Setups Reset Extended System Configuration Data (ESCD) Enable or Disable BIOS Control of System Resources Change Fan Speed Settings View CPU and System Temperatures View Fan Speeds View System Voltages Windows More Information on BIOS Before updating BIOS, check what version is currently running on your computer . When configuring updates, verify that you've downloaded the right file for your motherboard and that the computer not be shut down partway through or the update canceled abruptly. Interruptions could brick the motherboard and render the computer unusable, making it difficult to regain functionality. One way to avoid this problem is to use what's called a ""boot lock"" section of the BIOS software which gets updated on its own apart from the rest so that if corruption ensues, a recovery process prevents damage. BIOS might check if the full update has been applied by verifying that the checksum matches up with the intended value. If it doesn't, and the motherboard supports DualBIOS, that BIOS backup can be restored to overwrite the corrupted version. The BIOS in some of the first IBM computers were not interactive like modern-day implementations but instead only served to display error messages or beeps codes . Any custom options were instead made by modifying physical switches and jumpers . It wasn't until the 1990s that the BIOS Setup Utility (also known as the BIOS Configuration Utility, or BCU) became common practice. However, nowadays, BIOS has slowly been being replaced by UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) in newer computers, which offers benefits like a better user interface and a built-in, pre-OS platform for accessing the web. FAQ Is updating the BIOS a good thing? Updating the BIOS can be a good thing when your PC manufacturer is offering a BIOS update with improvements, security patches, bug fixes, and new hardware support. If something goes wrong during the updating process, however, there may be irreparable harm. BIOS updates don't usually offer any major speed boosts or new features, so if it's not a necessary update, it may be best to leave things along. What is a BIOS password? A BIOS password is an optional additional level of authentication protection. Through the BIOS Setup Utility, you can set up a Setup Password , which will require a password when a user is trying to access the BIOS Setup Utility, and a System Password , which will be required before the system can boot up. BIOS passwords are different from Windows account passwords. What is a PS2 BIOS file? A PS2 BIOS file is a way to play classic PlayStation 2 games on your Windows PC. To accomplish this, you'll also need to download a PS2 emulator and game ROMs. Some PS2 emulators include a PS2 BIOS file, which makes the process easier. Always download PS2 emulators, BIOS files, and game ROMs from trustworthy sources. What is a good BIOS time? In the Task Manager, under the Startup tab, you'll see Last BIOS Time and a number of seconds. This refers to how long it takes to go from starting up your computer to seeing the Windows logo on the screen. Anywhere from five to 15 seconds is a normal Last BIOS time. There are things you can do to speed up your Last BIOS time, such as setting your OS as the first boot drive and enabling Fast Boot. Was this page helpful? Thanks for letting us know!

It corresponds to the C stream stdin . The standard input stream is a source of characters determined by the environment. It is generally assumed to be input from an external source, such as the keyboard or a file. As an object of class istream , characters can be retrieved either as formatted data using the extraction operator ( operator ) or as unformatted data, using member functions such as read .

By default, cin is synchronized with stdin (see ios_base::sync_with_stdio ). A program should not mix input operations on cin with input operations on wcin (or with other wide-oriented input operations on stdin ): Once an input operation has been performed on either, the standard input stream acquires an orientation (either narrow or wide ) that can only be safely changed by calling freopen on stdin .

Maltz (Acting), Administrator Parent agency United States Department of Justice Website dea.gov The Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice tasked with combating illicit drug trafficking and distribution within the U.S. It is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act , sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection . The DEA is responsible for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestically and internationally. It was established in 1973 as part of the U.S. government's war on drugs . The DEA has an intelligence unit that is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community . While the unit is part of the DEA chain-of-command, it also reports to the director of national intelligence . The DEA has been criticized for scheduling drugs that have medicinal uses, and for focusing on operations that allow it to seize money rather than those involving drugs that cause more harm. [ citation needed ] History and mandate [ edit ] The Drug Enforcement Administration was established on July 1, 1973, [ 3 ] by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, signed by President Richard Nixon on July 28. [ 4 ] It proposed the creation of a single federal agency to enforce the federal drug laws as well as consolidate and coordinate the government's drug control activities. Congress accepted the proposal, as they were concerned with the growing availability of drugs. [ 5 ] As a result, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD), the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE); approximately 600 Special Agents of the Bureau of Customs, Customs Agency Service, and other federal offices merged to create the DEA. [ 6 ] The DEA is the primary federal agency charged with implementing and enforcing the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which is Title II of a larger Federal Act called the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 . The DEA is responsible for drugs listed in the CSA's five drug Schedules, categories that rank drugs by their potential for harm, and whether they have a medical use. The CSA seeks to ensure legitimate access to controlled pharmaceuticals, while preventing illicit use of controlled drugs. To these ends, the DEA implements two intersecting legal schemes created by the CSA, registration provisions for entities involved in legal activities, violations of which are not usually criminal offenses, and trafficking provisions for illegal activities, violations of which are criminal offenses. [ 7 ] From the early 1970s, DEA headquarters was located at 1405 I (""Eye"") Street NW in downtown Washington, D.C. With the overall growth of the agency in the 1980s (owing to the increased emphasis on federal drug law enforcement efforts) and concurrent growth in the headquarters staff, the DEA began to search for a new headquarters location; locations in Arkansas , Mississippi and various abandoned military bases around the United States were considered. However, then attorney general Edwin Meese determined that the headquarters had to be located close to the attorney general's office. Thus, in 1989, the headquarters relocated to 600700 Army-Navy Drive in the Pentagon City area of Arlington County, Virginia, near the eponymous Metro station . [ 8 ] Drug Enforcement Administration 25th Anniversary badge On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh carried out a terrorist attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City . He was targeting regional offices for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and DEA, all of which had carried out raids that he viewed as unjustified intrusions on the rights of the people. [ 9 ] This attack caused the deaths of two DEA employees, one task force member and two contractors in the Oklahoma City bombing . Subsequently, the DEA headquarters complex was classified as a Level IV installation under United States federal building security standards, meaning it was to be considered a high-risk law enforcement target for terrorists. [ 10 ] Security measures include hydraulic steel roadplates to enforce standoff distance from the building, metal detectors and guard stations. [ 11 ] In February 2003, the DEA established a Digital Evidence Laboratory within its Office of Forensic Sciences. [ 12 ] Organization [ edit ] Map of the 21 DEA domestic field divisions: 1. Chicago, 2. Detroit, 3. Atlanta, 4. Dallas, 5. Denver, 6. Boston, 7. El Paso, 8. Houston, 9. Los Angeles, 10. Miami, 11. Newark, 12. New Orleans, 13. New York, 14. Philadelphia, 15. Phoenix, 16. San Diego, 17. San Francisco, 18. Seattle, 19. St. Louis, 20. Caribbean (San Juan, Puerto Rico), 21. Washington, D.C. The DEA is headed by an administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate . The Administrator reports to the attorney general through the deputy attorney general . [ 13 ] The administrator is assisted by a deputy administrator, the chief of operations, the chief inspector, and three assistant administrators (for the Operations Support, Intelligence, and Human Resources divisions). Other senior staff includes the chief financial officer and the chief counsel. The administrator and deputy administrator are the only presidentially appointed personnel in the DEA; all other DEA officials are career government employees. DEA's headquarters is located in Arlington County, Virginia , across from the Pentagon . It maintains its own DEA Academy located on the Marine Corps Base Quantico at Quantico, Virginia , alongside the FBI Academy . As of 2024 [update] , it maintains 241 domestic offices in 23 divisions, and 93 foreign offices in 69 countries. [ 14 ] With a budget exceeding 3 billion, DEA employs 10,169 people, including 4,924 special agents and 800 intelligence analysts. [ citation needed ] [ needs update ] c. 2015 its headquarters and the DEA Museum were in 503,776 square feet (46,802.3 m 2 ) in Lincoln Place, a rented office building in Pentagon City in Arlington County, Virginia . In September 2018 this lease was scheduled to end. The General Services Administration (GSA), circa 2015, was checking to see where in Northern Virginia the DEA could be headquartered. [ 15 ] In 2018 the government of the United States extended the lease at Lincoln Place, now to expire circa 2033. [ 2 ] The DEA administration favored retaining the original location.

As of 2017, there were 4,650 special agents employed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. DEA agents' starting salary is 49,74655,483. After four years, the salary rises to above 92,592. This figure doesnt include Cost of living allowance (COLA) or LEAP which rated at 25 of base pay including COLA. Special Agents at the 13 step 5 level in high cost of living areas of the United States make near the federal pay cap of 191,000. [ 18 ] After receiving a conditional offer of employment, recruits must then complete an 18-week rigorous training which includes lessons in firearms proficiency (including basic marksmanship), weapons safety, tactical shooting, and deadly-force decision training. To graduate, students must maintain an academic average of 80 percent on academic examinations, pass the firearms qualification test, successfully demonstrate leadership and sound decision-making in practical scenarios, and pass rigorous physical-task tests. Upon graduation, recruits earn the title of DEA Special Agent. Because the DEA is responsible for enforcing the Controlled Substances Act , it excludes from consideration job applicants who use or have a recent history of using narcotics or illicit drugs. As of June 27, 2024, DEA applicants cannot have used cannabis or marijuana within three years of submitting their application and cannot have used any other narcotic substance within seven years of applying, although allowances are made for the use of marijuana prior to an applicant's 18th birthday. [ 19 ] Background investigations usually include a polygraph test for special-agent, diversion-investigator, and intelligence research specialist positions. [ citation needed ] The DEA's relatively firm stance on personal drug use contrasts with those of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which in 2023 considered further relaxing their eligibility guidelines so as to combat dwindling recruitment rates. [ 20 ] Aviation Division [ edit ] DEA Aviation Division logo The DEA Aviation Division or Office of Aviation Operations ( OA ) (formerly Aviation Section ) is an airborne division based in Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport, Texas . The current OA fleet consists of 106 aircraft and 124 DEA pilots. [ 21 ] The DEA shares a communications system with the Department of Defense for communication with state and regional enforcement independent of the Department of Justice and police information systems and is coordinated by an information command center called the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) near El Paso, Texas . Special Response Teams [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( January 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) DEA agents in MultiCam uniform burning hashish seized in Operation Albatross in Afghanistan, 2007 Rapid Response Teams ( RRT ), previously known as Foreign-Deployed Advisory and Support Teams ( FAST ), were decommissioned by DEA acting administrator Chuck Rosenburg in March 2017 via memorandum.  A need for domestic high-risk service teams led to the hybrid creation of specialized tactical units residing within various geographical regions throughout the United States. DEA officially created and standardized its Special Response Team ( SRT ) program in 2016. The SRT was designed as a stop-gap between tactical operations conducted by field agents and those necessitating specialized tactics as a result of elevated risks. SRT operators are highly trained in various weapons systems and entry tactics/maneuvers. Because of the clandestine nature of the DEA mission, SRT training protocols and activation requirements are highly sensitive and not available to the public.  Some of the SRT missions consist of high-risk arrests, vehicle assaults, air assault/infiltration, specialized surveillance, custody of high-profile individuals, dignitary and witness protection, tactical surveillance and interdiction, advanced breaching, tactical training to other police units, and urban and rural fugitive searches.  Covertly located throughout the nation, DEA SRT teams are available to respond to practically any CONUS geographical area with little to no preparation or notification.  The DEA SRT has been involved in several high-profile operations in recent years, however, DEA involvement is often not publicized due to operational and intelligence considerations.  Considered one of the most covert outfits in federal law enforcement, very little is known about DEA SRT capabilities and its operator selection process. In the past, DEA had other tactical teams like the High-risk Entry Apprehension Teams ( HEAT ) in some Field Divisions, and Operation Snowcap Teams (predecessor of FAST). The teams administered by the Mobile Enforcement Section, the Mobile Enforcement Teams ( MET ), and Regional Enforcement Teams ( RET ), were mobile investigative units intended to deploy resources to state and local agencies (MET) or DEA Field Divisions (RET) in need of assistance with a particular investigation or trafficking group. These programs ended in the early 2000s. Special Operations Division [ edit ] The DEA Special Operations Division ( SOD ) is a division within the DEA, which forwards information from wiretaps, intercepts, and databases from various sources to federal agents and local law enforcement officials. The SOD came under scrutiny following the 2010s global surveillance disclosures . [ 22 ] Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program [ edit ] The Domestic Cannabis Eradication / Suppression Program ( DCE / SP ) began funding eradication programs in Hawaii and California in 1979. The program rapidly expanded to include programs in 25 states by 1982. By 1985, all 50 states were participating in the DCE/SP. [ 23 ] In 2015, the DCE/SP was responsible for the eradication of 3,932,201 cultivated outdoor cannabis plants and 325,019 indoor plants for a total of 4,257,220 marijuana plants. In addition, the DCE/SP accounted for 6,278 arrests and the seizure in excess of 29.7 million of cultivator assets. [ 24 ] In 2014, the DEA spent 73,000 to eradicate marijuana plants in Utah, though they did not find a single marijuana plant. [ 25 ] Federal documents obtained by journalist Drew Atkins detail the DEA's continuing efforts to spend upwards of 14 million per year to completely eradicate marijuana within the United States despite the government funding allocation reports showing that the Marijuana Eradication Program often leads to the discovery of no marijuana plants. [ 26 ] This prompted twelve members of Congress to push for the elimination of the program and use the money instead to fund domestic-violence prevention and deficit-reduction programs. [ 27 ] Budget [ edit ] In 2018, the DEA budget was 2.086 billion. [ 28 ] 445 million was spent on international enforcement and 1.627 billion was spent on domestic enforcement. Breaking foreign and domestic sources of supply (1.0149 billion) via domestic cannabis eradication/suppression; domestic enforcement; research, engineering, and technical operations; the Foreign Cooperative Investigations Program; intelligence operations ( financial intelligence , operational intelligence , strategic intelligence , and the El Paso Intelligence Center ); and drug and chemical diversion control. Reduction of drug-related crime and violence (181.8 million) funding state and local teams and mobile enforcement teams. Demand reduction (3.3 million) via anti- legalization education, training for law enforcement personnel, youth programs, support for community-based coalitions, and sports drug awareness programs. Firearms [ edit ] DEA agents' primary service weapons are the Glock 17 and Glock 19 , Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun, and Rock River Arms LAR-15 semi-automatic carbine in 5.5645mm NATO . Agents may also qualify to carry a firearm listed on an authorized carry list maintained and updated by the Firearms Training Unit (FTU), Quantico, Virginia. Special Agents may qualify with their own personally-owned handguns, rifle, and shotgun, and certain handguns are allowed to be used with permission from the FTU. Agents are required to attend tactical and firearms proficiency training quarterly, and to qualify with their handguns twice per year. The DEA has one of the most challenging handgun qualification courses in all of the federal law enforcement. Failure to achieve a passing qualification score is the reason for most Academy dismissals and special agents in the field may have their authority to carry a firearm revoked for failure to qualify. Basic Agent Trainees (BATs) who fail the initial pistol qualification course of fire are placed in a remedial program to receive additional training. In remedial training, BATs receive five extra two-hour range sessions, for a total of 10 more hours of live fire training on their issued sidearm, to further aid them in helping pass the pistol qualification. After passing their pistol qualification, Basic Agent Trainees move on to receive formal training on the DEA's standard-issue long guns and will continue to frequently shoot the agency-issued sidearms that they have already qualified on. In all, BATs receive a total of 32 firearms training sessions, when combining classroom instruction, gear issue, and pistol, rifle, and shotgun live fire training at the DEA Academy. They will shoot the qualification courses for all three weapons systems during their initial training but must pass their final qualification attempts only on their Glock pistols to become a Special Agent. Two DEA agents in a shoot house exercise Agents are trained to use shoulder-fired weapons, such as the Rock River LAR-15, adopted in 2004, and the LWRC M6A2 , the standard carbine of DEA. The Colt 9mm SMG was previously issued, but no longer in service. Agents are required to complete a two-day (16-hour) proficiency course to carry a shoulder weapon on enforcement operations. They may carry a Rock River LAR-15 or LWRC carbine as authorized, personally-owned weapons, provided they meet the same training and proficiency standards. Impact on the drug trade [ edit ] See also: Illegal drug trade This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( March 2020 ) In 2005, the DEA seized a reported 1.4 billion in drug trade related assets and 477 million worth of drugs. [ 29 ] According to the White House's Office of Drug Control Policy , the total value of all of the drugs sold in the U.S. is as much as 64 billion a year, [ 30 ] giving the DEA an efficiency rate of less than 1 at intercepting the flow of drugs into and within the United States. Critics of the DEA (including recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , Milton Friedman , prior to his death a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ) point out that demand for illegal drugs is inelastic ; the people who are buying drugs will continue to buy them with little regard to price, often turning to crime to support expensive drug habits when the drug prices rise. One recent study by the DEA showed that the price of cocaine and methamphetamine is the highest it has ever been while the quality of both is at its lowest point ever. [ 31 ] This is contrary to a collection of data done by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which states that purity of street drugs has increased, while price has decreased. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] In contrast to the statistics presented by the DEA, the United States Department of Justice released data in 2003 showing that purity of methamphetamine was on the rise. [ 35 ] Registration and licensing [ edit ] ""Operation Somalia Express"" was an 18-month investigation that included the coordinated takedown of a 44-member international narcotics-trafficking organization responsible for smuggling more than 25 tons of khat from the Horn of Africa to the United States. The DEA has a registration system in place which authorizes anyone to manufacture, import, export, and distribute by filing DEA form 225 Archived November 8, 2015, at the Wayback Machine along with medical professionals, researchers and manufacturers access to "" Schedule I "" drugs, as well as Schedules 2, 3, 4 and 5. Authorized registrants apply for and, if granted, receive a "" DEA number "". An entity that has been issued a DEA number is authorized to manufacture (drug companies), distribute research, prescribe (doctors, pharmacists , nurse practitioners and physician assistants, etc.), or dispense (pharmacy) a controlled substance. Diversion control system [ edit ] Many problems associated with substance use disorders are the result of legitimately manufactured controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into the illicit drug traffic. Many of the analgesics, depressants and stimulants manufactured for legitimate medical use can often carry the potential for addiction. Therefore, those scheduled substances have been brought under legal control for prevention and population safety. The goal of controls is to ensure that these ""controlled substances"" are readily available for medical use while preventing their distribution for illicit distribution and non-medical use. This can be a difficult task, sometimes providing difficulty for legitimate patients and healthcare providers while circumventing illegal trade and consumption of scheduled drugs. Under federal law, all businesses which manufacture or distribute controlled drugs, all health professionals entitled to dispense, administer or prescribe them, and all pharmacies entitled to fill prescriptions must register with the DEA. Registrants must comply with a series of regulatory requirements relating to drug security, records accountability, and adherence to standards. All of these investigations are conducted by Diversion Investigators (DIs). DIs conduct investigations to uncover and investigate suspected sources of diversion and take appropriate civil and administrative actions. Prescription Database Management Programs (PDMP) aid and facilitate investigation and surveillance. [ citation needed ] Fentanyl overdose crisis [ edit ] In 2019 and 2020, record overdoses from illicit fentanyl tablets or as a deadly adulterant in heroin have ravaged North America. An estimated 19,416 individuals died of a drug overdose in the United States in the first 3 months of 2020 compared with 16,682 in the same 3-month period in 2019; this trend was fueled by synthetic opioids (especially illicitly manufactured fentanyl and analogs). Furthermore, between May 2020 and April 2021, the estimated number of drug overdose deaths in the United States exceeded 100,000 over this time period, with 64.0 of deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (the same illicitly manufactured fentanyls and analogs). [ 36 ] In contrast, Europe has seen a decrease from heroin overdoses, and a practical absence of illicit, synthetic opioids. Fentanyl, originally developed in the 1970s by Janssen Pharmaceutica , is a potent anesthetic primarily used in hospital or hospice settings. In Europe, heroin is mainly supplied from Western Asia (from Afghanistan and neighboring countries), and less likely to be contaminated with fentanyl. In North America, there are now fewer deaths involving heroin than either meth or cocaine, a striking change that has taken place over the last two years as heroin has all but disappeared from some regions. Due to the absence of heroin from Asian sources, fentanyl-laced heroin powder or tablets have filled that void. [ 37 ] In October 2021, the US reported another record in fentanyl deaths, as federal agencies were unable to stem the tide of illicit, synthetic drugs entering the US. Originally, introduced to replace much of the white powder heroin in the Eastern United States, the drug continues to move further west. Between July 2019December 2020, illicitly manufactured fentanyl involved deaths increased sharply in midwestern (33.1), southern (64.7), and western (93.9) jurisdictions. MDMA DEA scheduling overturn [ edit ] In 1985 MDMA and its analogues were under review by the American government as a drug with a potential for addiction. During this time, several public hearings on the new drug were held by the DEA. Based on all of the evidence and facts presented at the time, the DEA's administrative law judge did not see MDMA and its analogues as being of large concern and recommended that they be placed in Schedule III. The DEA administrator, expressing concern for addictive potential, overruled the recommendation and ruled that MDMA be put in Schedule I, the Controlled Substances Act 's most restrictive category. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Rank structure [ edit ] The following is a listing of the rank structure found within the DEA (in ascending order): Agents Agent Trainee Special Agent Senior Special Agent Supervising Special Agent Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Management Assistant Administrator Associate Deputy Administrator Deputy Administrator Principal Deputy Administrator Chief of Staff Administrator Line of duty deaths [ edit ] 54 DEA agents have been killed in the line of duty. [ 41 ] Criticism and controversies [ edit ] See also: Criticism of the United States government  Criticism of agencies The DEA has been criticized for placing highly restrictive schedules on a few drugs that researchers in the fields of pharmacology and medicine regard as having medical uses. Critics assert that some such decisions are motivated primarily by political factors stemming from the U.S. government's war on drugs and that many benefits of such substances remain unrecognized due to the difficulty of conducting scientific research. A counterpoint to that criticism is that under the Controlled Substances Act it is the Department of Health and Human Services (through the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse ), not the DEA, which has the legal responsibility to make scientific and medical determinations with respect to drug scheduling; no drug can be scheduled if the secretary of health and human services recommends against it on a scientific or medical basis, and no drug can be placed in the most restrictive schedule ( Schedule I ) if DHHS finds that the drug has an accepted medical use. Jon Gettman 's essay Science and the End of Marijuana Prohibition describes the DEA as ""a fall guy to deflect responsibility from the key decision-makers"" and opines, ""HHS calls the shots when it comes to marijuana prohibition, and the cops at DEA and the general over at ONDCP take the heat."" [ citation needed ] The DEA is also criticized for focusing on the operations from which it can seize the most money, [ 42 ] namely the organized cross-border trafficking of marijuana . Some individuals contemplating the nature of the DEA's charter advise that, based on danger, the DEA should be most focused on cocaine. Others suggest that, based on opiate popularity, the DEA should focus much more on prescription opiates used recreationally, which critics contend comes first before users switch to heroin. Practitioners who legally prescribe medicine however must possess a valid DEA license. According to federal law, the budget of the DEA Diversion Control Program is to be paid by these license fees. In 1984 a three-year license cost 25. In 2009 the fee for a three-year license was 551. Some have likened this approach to license fees unreasonable, ""like making pilot licenses support the entire Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) budget."" The renewal fee for 2020 as of October 1, 2020, is 888 for a three-year license. [ 43 ] In 2005, the DEA estimated that it had over 4,000 informants without which they ""could not effectively enforce the controlled substances laws of the United States."" [ 44 ] To gather information, agents permitted their informants to  buy and sell drugs, engage in Medicaid fraud rings, and other illicit acts. [ 44 ] Despite this, the DEA claims that they are ""in compliance"" with the rules for using informants to gather information about illicit activities. [ 44 ] Costs [ edit ] The total budget of the DEA from 1972 to 2014, according to the agency website, was 50.6 billion. The agency had 11,055 employees in 2014. For the year 2014 the average cost per arrest made was 97,325. [ 45 ] Civil liberties [ edit ] Others, such as former Republican congressman Ron Paul, the Cato Institute , [ 46 ] The Libertarian Party [ 47 ] and the Drug Policy Alliance [ 48 ] criticize the very existence of the DEA and the war on drugs as both hostile, and contrary, to the concept of civil liberties by arguing that anybody should be free to put any substance they choose into their own bodies for any reason, particularly when legal drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and prescription drugs are also open to addiction, and that any harm caused by a drug user or addict to the general public is a case of conflicting civil rights. Recurrently, billions of dollars are spent yearly, focusing largely on criminal law and demand reduction campaigns, which has resulted in the imprisonment of thousands of U.S. citizens. [ 49 ] Demand for recreational drugs is somewhat static as the market for most illegal drugs has been saturated, forcing the cartels to expand their market to Europe and other areas than the United States. [ citation needed ] United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug. [ 50 ] Incarceration of Daniel Chong [ edit ] Main article: Incarceration of Daniel Chong In April 2012 in San Diego, California , DEA agents detained a student, Daniel Chong, and left him locked in a holding room for five days. The cell contained no food, water or bathroom facilities. [ 51 ] When he was found, he had to be hospitalized for several days for a variety of medical problems. The incident touched off a national furor, resulting in several investigations. The incident has been described as a "" Kafkaesque nightmare,"" [ 52 ] a ""debacle,"" and ""one of the worst cases of its kind."" [ 53 ] Chong subsequently sued the DEA; the government settled the suit for 4.1 million. [ 54 ] Department of Justice Smart on Crime Program [ edit ] On August 12, 2013, at the American Bar Association 's House of Delegates meeting, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the ""Smart on Crime"" program, which is ""a sweeping initiative by the Justice Department that in effect renounces several decades of tough-on-crime anti-drug legislation and policies."" [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Holder said the program ""will encourage U.S. attorneys to charge defendants only with crimes ""for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct, rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins..."" [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Running through Holder's statements, the increasing economic burden of over-incarceration was stressed. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] As of August 2013 [update] , the Smart on Crime program is not a legislative initiative but an effort ""limited to the DOJ's policy parameters."" [ 55 ] [ 56 ] International events [ edit ] David Coleman Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani, June 30, 1960) who was working as an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) simultaneously made periodic trips to Pakistan for LeT training and was one of the main conspirators in the 2008 Mumbai attacks . On January 24, 2013, Headley, then 52 years old, was sentenced by U.S. district judge Harry Leinenweber of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago to 35 years in prison for his part in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which at least 164 victims (civilians and security personnel) and nine attackers were killed. Among the dead were 28 foreign nationals from 10 countries. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] One attacker was captured. [ 58 ] The bodies of many of the dead hostages showed signs of torture or disfigurement. [ 62 ] A number of those killed were notable figures in business, media, and security services. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The DEA was accused in 2005 by the Venezuelan government of collaborating with drug traffickers, after which President Hugo Chvez decided to end any collaboration with the agency. In 2007, after the U.S. State Department criticized Venezuela in its annual report on drug trafficking, the Venezuelan Minister of Justice reiterated the accusations: ""A large quantity of drug shipments left the country through that organization. We were in the presence of a new drug cartel ."" [ 66 ] In his 1996 series of articles and subsequent 1999 book , both titled Dark Alliance, journalist Gary Webb asserts that the DEA helped harbor Nicaraguan drug traffickers. Notably, they allowed Oscar Danilo Blandn political asylum in the USA despite knowledge of his cocaine-trafficking organization. [ 67 ] The government of Bolivia has also taken similar steps to ban the DEA from operating in the country. In September 2008, Bolivia drastically reduced diplomatic ties with the United States, withdrawing its ambassador from the US and expelling the US ambassador from Bolivia. This occurred soon after Bolivian president Evo Morales expelled all DEA agents from the country due to a revolt in the traditional coca-growing Chapare Province . The Bolivian government claimed that it could not protect the agents, and Morales further accused the agency of helping incite the violence, which claimed 30 lives. National agencies were to take over control of drug management. [ 68 ] Three years later, Bolivia and the US began to restore full diplomatic ties. However, Morales maintained that the DEA would remain unwelcome in the country, characterising it as an affront to Bolivia's ""dignity and sovereignty"". [ 69 ] In the Netherlands, both the Dutch government and the DEA have been criticized for violations of Dutch sovereignty in drug investigations. According to Peter R. de Vries , a Dutch journalist present at the 2005 trial of Henk Orlando Rommy, the DEA has admitted to activities on Dutch soil. Earlier, then Minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner , had denied to the Dutch parliament that he had given permission to the DEA for any such activities, which would have been a requirement by Dutch law in order to allow foreign agents to act within the territory. [ 70 ] The DEA conducted a covert operation over several years in which undercover operatives were sent to Venezuela to build drug-trafficking cases against Venezuela's leadership, including Nicholas Maduro . The plan was part of ""Operation Money Badger"", which the DEA and prosecutors in Miami created in 2013. It potentially breached Venezuelan and international law and therefore required the approval of the Sensitive Activity Review Committee, a secretive panel of senior State and Justice Department officials that oversees the most sensitive DEA cases involving tricky ethical, legal or foreign policy considerations. [ 71 ] Following the Colombian peace process , which brought an end to the Colombian conflict between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARCEP), the Special Jurisdiction for Peace found that the DEA had plotted with Colombian Attorney General Nstor Humberto Martnez to fabricate drug trafficking charges against Jess Santrich , in a bid to jeopardize the peace agreement by inciting the FARC to take up arms again. [ 72 ] Special Operations Division fabricated evidence trails [ edit ] In 2013, Reuters published a report about the DEA's Special Operations Division (SOD) stating that it conceals where an investigative trail about a suspect truly originates from and creates a parallel set of evidence given to prosecutors, judges, and defense lawyers. This DEA program mainly affects common criminals such as drug dealers. The concealment of evidence means the defendant is unaware of how his or her investigation began and will be unable to request a review of possible sources of exculpatory evidence. Exculpatory evidence may include biased witnesses, mistakes, or entrapment. Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge who had served from 1994 to 2011 and a Harvard Law School professor, stated that ""It is one thing to create special rules for national security. Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations."" [ 73 ] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon wrote that ""It's the first clear evidence that the special rules and disregard for constitutional law that have characterized the hunt for so-called terrorists have crept into the domestic criminal justice system on a significant scale."" [ 74 ] Cannabis rescheduling [ edit ] A 2014 report by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies and the Drug Policy Alliance accuses the DEA of unfairly blocking the removal of cannabis from Schedule I . The report alleges that the methods employed by the DEA to achieve this include: delaying rescheduling petitions for years, overruling DEA administrative law judges , and systematically impeding scientific research. [ 75 ] The DEA continues to refuse the removal of cannabis from Schedule I despite wide-scale acceptance of the substance among the medical community, including 76 of doctors, for the treatment of various diseases . [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Domestic anti-drug advocacy [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( September 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The DEA, in addition to enforcement, also regularly engage in advocacy, specifically against rescheduling marijuana, by publishing policy-based papers on certain drugs. Some [ who? ] have criticized the DEA for using tax dollars in what they call an attempt to change public opinion, which they call an overreach from the scope of the agency's job of enforcement, and that by releasing such non-peer-reviewed reports is a transparent attempt to justify its own activities. They have claimed that since the DEA is not, by law, an advocacy group, but a legal enforcement group, that those press releases are tantamount to what they consider domestic propaganda. [ citation needed ] Raids on medical marijuana dispensaries [ edit ] People protesting medical marijuana raids The DEA has taken a particularly strong stance on enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act on persons and organizations acting within state laws that allow medical cannabis cultivation and distribution. [ 79 ] DEA agency executive Chuck Rosenberg has made negative statements against patients who use medical marijuana. [ citation needed ] Rosenberg has mentioned that he considers medical marijuana to be a ""joke"". [ citation needed ] As a reaction against the negative statements made by Rosenberg towards medical marijuana, an international online petition has been formed. More than 159,737 signatures have been gathered globally with the intention that Rosenberg be fired or forced to resign as head of DEA. [ 80 ] ""The people of California and the County of Santa Cruz have overwhelmingly supported the provision of medical marijuana for people who have serious illnesses,"" county Supervisor Mardi Wormhoudt told the San Francisco Chronicle . ""These people (blocking the road) are people with AIDS and cancer and other grave illnesses. To attack these people, who work collectively and have never taken money for their work, is outrageous."" [ 81 ] [ 82 ] As a result, the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, with the City and County of Santa Cruz, had sued the DEA, Attorney General Michael Mukasey , and the ONDCP . The most recent court decision rejected the government's motion to dismiss, which allowed discovery to move forward. The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision as ""a first-of-its-kind ruling."" [ 83 ] More recently, the DEA has escalated its enforcement efforts on the recently proliferated Los Angeles area medical cannabis collectives. On July 25, 2007, the DEA raided the California Patients Group, Hollywood Compassionate Collective, and Natural Hybrid (NHI Caregivers) in Hollywood, California. [ 84 ] Earlier that day, the operators of those collectives participated in a press conference with LA City Council members announcing the city's intention to regulate the collectives and asking the DEA to halt raids on collectives while the City drafted regulations. [ citation needed ] The dispensary operator of Natural Hybrid (NHI Caregivers) was forced to close down the collective due to the tremendous loss caused by the DEA conducted joint task force raid against them. [ citation needed ] Project Cassandra [ edit ] Main article: Project Cassandra In 2008 the Special Operations part of the agency launched a multi-agency effort named Project Cassandra [ 85 ] to investigate Hezbollah for allegations of illicit drug trafficking and terrorist financing. The investigation identified an Iranian cell in the U.S. which worked in concert with a Lebanese bank called the Lebanese Canadian Bank to launder money using the purchase of used automobiles exported to Africa. Project Cassandra also identified hemispheric drug syndicates involved in cocaine trafficking in order to finance Hezbollah activities. The Department of Justice issued several sealed indictments but declined to seize, prosecute, extradite, or further investigate likely targets of these alleged foreign criminal activities operating in the United States due to White House diplomatic objectives involving the international nuclear agreement with Iran. [ 86 ] On December 22, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a review of prior cases in the project. [ 87 ] DEA Museum [ edit ] Main article: Drug Enforcement Administration Museum and Visitors Center In 1999, the DEA opened the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum in Arlington County, Virginia . The original permanent exhibit  Illegal Drugs in America: A Modern History  remains the museum's centerpiece.  The exhibit features ""the more than 150 year history of drugs and drug abuse and the DEA,"" including a considerable collection of drug paraphernalia and an image of a smiling drug vendor under the heading ""Jimmy's Joint"". [ 88 ] In popular culture [ edit ] The DEA are commonly featured in crime drama films and TV, as both protagonists and antagonists. Hank Schrader is one of the main protagonists in AMC's Breaking Bad . He is both a DEA agent (later promoted to ASAC) and brother-in-law to drug kingpin Walter White , unknowingly investigating Walt's alter-ego Heisenberg for the duration of the show. Javier Pea and Stephen Murphy are two of the main protagonists in Netflix's Narcos . They are responsible for the capture and killing of the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on December 2, 1993, of which the show was based on. Norman Stansfield leads a team of corrupt DEA agents, who along with the NYPD, hunt an assassin in the 1994 movie Lon: The Professional . In the film Sabotage , a group of special agents with the DEA's Special Operations Team, are hunted down after stealing a large amount of cartel cash during a raid.

Browsers also use the DOCTYPE to determine how to render a page. Not including a DOCTYPE or including an incorrect one can trigger quirks mode. The kicker here is, that quirks mode in Internet Explorer is quite different from quirks mode in Firefox (and other browsers); meaning that you'll have a much harder job, trying to ensure your page renders consistently with all browsers if the quirks mode is triggered, than you will if it is rendered in standards mode. Wikipedia has a more in-depth summary of the differences in rendering when using various DOCTYPEs . XHTML is enabled by certain DOCTYPEs, and there is quite a bit of debate about the use of XHTML which is covered well in XHTML  myths and reality . There are subtle differences between different ""standards compliant"" rendering DOCTYPEs, such as the HTML5 DOCTYPE ( !DOCTYPE html , prior to HTML5, only known as the ""skinny doctype"" which does not trigger standardized rendering in older browsers) and other DOCTYPEs such as this one for HTML 4.01 transitional: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"" Share Improve this answer Follow edited May 8, 2020 at 21:35 La Gris 19.7k 4 4 gold badges 37 37 silver badges 51 51 bronze badges answered Jan 6, 2009 at 0:06 Walter Rumsby Walter Rumsby 7,535 6 6 gold badges 42 42 silver badges 37 37 bronze badges 2 40 These days I favour the HTML5 DOCTYPE:      !DOCTYPE html  it works in all modern browsers, including IE6.

Using it ensures that the consumer correctly parses the HTML as you intended it. There are several different DOCTYPES for HTML, XHTML, and Framesets and each of these has two modes Strict and Transitional.  Strict says that your markup is using the defined standards exactly.  See W3C DTDs page for further details. Quirksmode is basically the layout method from the browser wars days when the standards were much less respected and defined. Generally a standards mode page, that is valid, will layout more consistently across various browsers, but may lack certain features that you require. One such features is the anchor tag's target attribute.  The Quirksmode site is a great resource for these differences. One final thought is that the new HTML5 standard proposes using a very simple DOCTYPE: !DOCTYPE html Using this DOCTYPE is a forward compatible way to specify that your pages are in standards mode, and are HTML. This is the method that Google uses, and is reasonably easy to remember. I recommend using this DOCTYPE unless you plan to use XHTML.

If so, then why do we need this to begin with?  CuriousMind Commented Jan 13, 2015 at 15:07 2 vipinkoul the DOCTYPE tag specifies what type of HTML document you are sending the User-Agent. It could be HTML or XHTML or a Frameset. And it could be Strict HTML/XHTML/Frameset or Transitional HTML/XHTML/Frameset. Mostly this effects how the parser reacts when it encounters an error.  Rob Commented May 14, 2015 at 0:03 Add a comment  6 A doctype defines which version of HTML/XHTML your document uses. You would want to use a doctype so that when you run your code through validators, the validators know which version of HTML/XHTML to check against. This page provides a good overview: Don't forget to add a doctype Common doctypes you can use are listed here: Recommended list of DTDs Which doctype you should go with depends on the code you're using, but to get an idea, try running your code through the W3C validator and use the Document Type drop-down menu in the ""More Options"" menu to try different doctypes out. W3C Markup Validation Service Share Improve this answer Follow edited Jan 6, 2009 at 1:52 answered Jan 5, 2009 at 23:24 GR1000 GR1000 0 Add a comment  4 In HTML (including XHTML) as used on web pages, DOCTYPE is a string that triggers one of a few browser modes (quirks mode, standards mode, almost standards mode), depending on the exact spelling of the DOCTYPE. You want to use it to select a browser mode that best suits your page. Formally, in SGML and XML, a DOCTYPE declaration is a reference to a Document Type Definition (DTD), which specifies the formal syntax rules of the markup language. No browser has ever used DTDs for anything or even accessed them. However, they are used by SGML and XML markup validators such as the W3C Markup Validator , except in HTML5 mode. Therefore, the choice of DOCTYPE determines how a validator works if the document is submitted to it. However, the validator mode of operation can also be selected in its user interface. (SGML and XML processors may use DOCTYPEs in different other ways, too, but the question is apparently meant to be limited to the HTML context and to web browsers and closely related software.) There is no authoritative list of DOCTYPEs. Each HTML specification or draft defines its own DOCTYPE, or DOCTYPEs. The set of DOCTYPEs recognized by browsers when selecting mode varies by browser. In practice, there is no reason to use a DOCTYPE other than DOCTYPE html as defined in HTML5 , though HTML5 also lists a few legacy DOCTYPEs. You can use that DOCTYPE if you want standards mode (recommended for new pages) and use no DOCTYPE if you want quirks mode (which you may need for legacy pages). Standards mode generally means the mode of operation where a browser follows HTML, CSS, DOM and other specifications the best it can. It does not usually mean full conformance. Quirks mode is different in different browsers, but generally it means an attempt at imitating the behavior of very old browsers like IE 5. The purpose is to keep old pages working, under the assumption that they may rely on features and bugs in the old browsers. See the description What happens in Quirks Mode? Note that there is a rather different, more limited concept of quirks mode in HTML5, which closely resembles the document called Quirks Mode Living Standard . A typical issue is that element widths are calculated differently in quirks mode and in standards mode. This means that the layout of a page may be more or less changed or even totally messed up, if a page designed to work in quirks mode is viewed in standards mode (or vice versa). So you should use !DOCTYPE html for new pages and keep whatever DOCTYPE (if any) you have been using for old pages. However, quirks mode means, in some browsers, that many new features of CSS are not supported. This means that if you want to enhance an old page with some CSS3 feature, it may well be necessary to switch to a DOCTYPE that triggers standards mode. In such a case, you need to review and test the page to see whether it will run in standards mode. Share Improve this answer Follow answered Jan 15, 2015 at 15:19 Jukka K. Korpela Jukka K.

Armfoot Commented Feb 16, 2016 at 15:14 Add a comment  2 A doctype is a document that describes how the contents of a xhtml-like document can look like (like a webpage). Note: this defines only the syntax of said page, the rendering of the page is NOT defined by the DTD! For example, a doctype could define how the table -tag can look like - which attributes it accepts, and which values/valuetypes are accepted for each attribute. Think of it as a lexicon for your current webpage. Wikipedia has an informative page on the various Doctypes that are in common use. Mind you - there's nothing stopping you from creating your own doctype. The chances are, however, that the browser probably doesn't know how to render your document. Which DTD to use depends on what you are going to write. XHTML has a whole different DTD than HTML, for example.

For example, !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN""     ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"" tell the browser to render the page as HTML4 strict . Older browsers used to render pages incorrectly and therefore newer browsers simulate errors of the older browsers when they find an old doctype. Today you should use at least HTML4 or better XHTML.

A doctype is nothing more than a declaration of what tags you can use within your html (though the browsers can use more or less than what is defined) You can actually open up the doctype file and start reading ( XHTML 1.0 Strict ) If you do not specify a doctype, the browser will try its best to guess but not always hits the correct type.

What changes in quirks mode depends on the browser: Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome implement a limited set of quirks, like removing the space for text descenders in code like tabletrtdimg/td/tr/table (solution: td img  vertical-align:bottom;  ). IE, on the other hand, reverts to the rendering engine in IE5.5. That means that you won't be able to use any of the new features implemented since 2000. To trigger standards mode, I suggest using the HTML5 doctype, doctype html , as it is the easiest to remember.

Browsers also use the DOCTYPE to determine how to render a page. Not including a DOCTYPE or including an incorrect one can trigger quirks mode. The kicker here is, that quirks mode in Internet Explorer is quite different from quirks mode in Firefox (and other browsers); meaning that you'll have a much harder job, trying to ensure your page renders consistently with all browsers if the quirks mode is triggered, than you will if it is rendered in standards mode. Wikipedia has a more in-depth summary of the differences in rendering when using various DOCTYPEs . XHTML is enabled by certain DOCTYPEs, and there is quite a bit of debate about the use of XHTML which is covered well in XHTML  myths and reality . There are subtle differences between different ""standards compliant"" rendering DOCTYPEs, such as the HTML5 DOCTYPE ( !DOCTYPE html , prior to HTML5, only known as the ""skinny doctype"" which does not trigger standardized rendering in older browsers) and other DOCTYPEs such as this one for HTML 4.01 transitional: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"" Share Improve this answer Follow edited May 8, 2020 at 21:35 La Gris 19.7k 4 4 gold badges 37 37 silver badges 51 51 bronze badges answered Jan 6, 2009 at 0:06 Walter Rumsby Walter Rumsby 7,535 6 6 gold badges 42 42 silver badges 37 37 bronze badges 2 40 These days I favour the HTML5 DOCTYPE:      !DOCTYPE html  it works in all modern browsers, including IE6.

Using it ensures that the consumer correctly parses the HTML as you intended it. There are several different DOCTYPES for HTML, XHTML, and Framesets and each of these has two modes Strict and Transitional.  Strict says that your markup is using the defined standards exactly.  See W3C DTDs page for further details. Quirksmode is basically the layout method from the browser wars days when the standards were much less respected and defined. Generally a standards mode page, that is valid, will layout more consistently across various browsers, but may lack certain features that you require. One such features is the anchor tag's target attribute.  The Quirksmode site is a great resource for these differences. One final thought is that the new HTML5 standard proposes using a very simple DOCTYPE: !DOCTYPE html Using this DOCTYPE is a forward compatible way to specify that your pages are in standards mode, and are HTML. This is the method that Google uses, and is reasonably easy to remember. I recommend using this DOCTYPE unless you plan to use XHTML.

If so, then why do we need this to begin with?  CuriousMind Commented Jan 13, 2015 at 15:07 2 vipinkoul the DOCTYPE tag specifies what type of HTML document you are sending the User-Agent. It could be HTML or XHTML or a Frameset. And it could be Strict HTML/XHTML/Frameset or Transitional HTML/XHTML/Frameset. Mostly this effects how the parser reacts when it encounters an error.  Rob Commented May 14, 2015 at 0:03 Add a comment  6 A doctype defines which version of HTML/XHTML your document uses. You would want to use a doctype so that when you run your code through validators, the validators know which version of HTML/XHTML to check against. This page provides a good overview: Don't forget to add a doctype Common doctypes you can use are listed here: Recommended list of DTDs Which doctype you should go with depends on the code you're using, but to get an idea, try running your code through the W3C validator and use the Document Type drop-down menu in the ""More Options"" menu to try different doctypes out. W3C Markup Validation Service Share Improve this answer Follow edited Jan 6, 2009 at 1:52 answered Jan 5, 2009 at 23:24 GR1000 GR1000 0 Add a comment  4 In HTML (including XHTML) as used on web pages, DOCTYPE is a string that triggers one of a few browser modes (quirks mode, standards mode, almost standards mode), depending on the exact spelling of the DOCTYPE. You want to use it to select a browser mode that best suits your page. Formally, in SGML and XML, a DOCTYPE declaration is a reference to a Document Type Definition (DTD), which specifies the formal syntax rules of the markup language. No browser has ever used DTDs for anything or even accessed them. However, they are used by SGML and XML markup validators such as the W3C Markup Validator , except in HTML5 mode. Therefore, the choice of DOCTYPE determines how a validator works if the document is submitted to it. However, the validator mode of operation can also be selected in its user interface. (SGML and XML processors may use DOCTYPEs in different other ways, too, but the question is apparently meant to be limited to the HTML context and to web browsers and closely related software.) There is no authoritative list of DOCTYPEs. Each HTML specification or draft defines its own DOCTYPE, or DOCTYPEs. The set of DOCTYPEs recognized by browsers when selecting mode varies by browser. In practice, there is no reason to use a DOCTYPE other than DOCTYPE html as defined in HTML5 , though HTML5 also lists a few legacy DOCTYPEs. You can use that DOCTYPE if you want standards mode (recommended for new pages) and use no DOCTYPE if you want quirks mode (which you may need for legacy pages). Standards mode generally means the mode of operation where a browser follows HTML, CSS, DOM and other specifications the best it can. It does not usually mean full conformance. Quirks mode is different in different browsers, but generally it means an attempt at imitating the behavior of very old browsers like IE 5. The purpose is to keep old pages working, under the assumption that they may rely on features and bugs in the old browsers. See the description What happens in Quirks Mode? Note that there is a rather different, more limited concept of quirks mode in HTML5, which closely resembles the document called Quirks Mode Living Standard . A typical issue is that element widths are calculated differently in quirks mode and in standards mode. This means that the layout of a page may be more or less changed or even totally messed up, if a page designed to work in quirks mode is viewed in standards mode (or vice versa). So you should use !DOCTYPE html for new pages and keep whatever DOCTYPE (if any) you have been using for old pages. However, quirks mode means, in some browsers, that many new features of CSS are not supported. This means that if you want to enhance an old page with some CSS3 feature, it may well be necessary to switch to a DOCTYPE that triggers standards mode. In such a case, you need to review and test the page to see whether it will run in standards mode. Share Improve this answer Follow answered Jan 15, 2015 at 15:19 Jukka K. Korpela Jukka K.

Armfoot Commented Feb 16, 2016 at 15:14 Add a comment  2 A doctype is a document that describes how the contents of a xhtml-like document can look like (like a webpage). Note: this defines only the syntax of said page, the rendering of the page is NOT defined by the DTD! For example, a doctype could define how the table -tag can look like - which attributes it accepts, and which values/valuetypes are accepted for each attribute. Think of it as a lexicon for your current webpage. Wikipedia has an informative page on the various Doctypes that are in common use. Mind you - there's nothing stopping you from creating your own doctype. The chances are, however, that the browser probably doesn't know how to render your document. Which DTD to use depends on what you are going to write. XHTML has a whole different DTD than HTML, for example.

For example, !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN""     ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"" tell the browser to render the page as HTML4 strict . Older browsers used to render pages incorrectly and therefore newer browsers simulate errors of the older browsers when they find an old doctype. Today you should use at least HTML4 or better XHTML.

Cummings . E. E. Cummings Cummings in 1953 Born Edward Estlin Cummings ( 1894-10-14 ) October 14, 1894 Cambridge, Massachusetts , U.S. Died September 3, 1962 (1962-09-03) (aged 67) Madison, New Hampshire , U.S. Occupation Author Alma mater Harvard University Signature Edward Estlin Cummings (October 14, 1894  September 3, 1962), commonly known as e e cummings or E. E. Cummings , was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. During World War I , he worked as an ambulance driver and was imprisoned in an internment camp, which provided the basis for his novel The Enormous Room in 1922. The following year he published his first collection of poetry, Tulips and Chimneys , which showed his early experiments with grammar and typography. He wrote four plays; HIM (1927) and Santa Claus: A Morality (1946) were the most successful ones. He wrote EIMI (1933), a travelog of the Soviet Union, and delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in poetry, published as isix nonlectures (1953). Fairy Tales (1965), a collection of short stories, was published posthumously. Cummings wrote approximately 2,900 poems. He is often regarded as one of the most important American poets of the 20th century. He is associated with modernist free-form poetry , and much of his work uses idiosyncratic syntax and lower-case spellings for poetic expression. M. L. Rosenthal wrote: The chief effect of Cummings' jugglery with syntax, grammar, and diction was to blow open otherwise trite and bathetic motifs through a dynamic rediscovery of the energies sealed up in conventional usage ... He succeeded masterfully in splitting the atom of the cute commonplace. [ 1 ] For Norman Friedman, Cummings's inventions ""are best understood as various ways of stripping the film of familiarity from language to strip the film of familiarity from the world. Transform the word, he seems to have felt, and you are on the way to transforming the world."" [ 2 ] The poet Randall Jarrell said of Cummings, ""No one else has ever made avant-garde, experimental poems so attractive to the general and the special reader."" James Dickey wrote, ""I think that Cummings is a daringly original poet, with more vitality and more sheer, uncompromising talent than any other living American writer."" Dickey described himself as ""ashamed and even a little guilty in picking out flaws"" in Cummings's poetry, which he compared to noting ""the aesthetic defects in a rose. It is better to say what must finally be said about Cummings: that he has helped to give life to the language."" [ 3 ] Life [ edit ] Early years [ edit ] Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in Cambridge, Massachusetts , to  Edward Cummings and Rebecca Haswell ( ne Clarke ), a well-known Unitarian upper-class couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University who later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts . [ 4 ] His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Edward and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings's parents supported his creative gifts. [ 5 ] Cummings wrote poems and drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of family friends such as the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce . Many of Cummings's summers were spent on Silver Lake in Madison, New Hampshire , where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby Joy Farm where Cummings had his primary summer residence. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He expressed transcendental leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an ""I, Thou"" relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ""le bon Dieu,"" as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as ""Bon Dieu! may i some day do something truly great. amen.""). Cummings ""also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayernot may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul;  may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')"". [ 8 ] Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He studied Latin and Greek at Cambridge Latin High School . He attended Harvard University , graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society in 1915. The following year, he received a Master of Arts degree from the university. During his studies at Harvard, he developed an interest in modern poetry, which ignored conventional grammar and syntax and aimed for a dynamic use of language. His first published poems appeared in Eight Harvard Poets (1917). Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer. [ 9 ] Masthead from volume 56 of The Harvard Monthly ; Cummings was an editor and contributor to this literary journal while at Harvard War years [ edit ] In 1917, with the First World War going on in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps . On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown and they quickly became friends. [ 9 ] Due to an administrative error, Cummings and Brown did not receive an assignment for five weeks, a period they spent exploring Paris . Cummings fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life. [ 10 ] During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views, Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans. [ 11 ] On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities, they were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the Dpt de Triage , in La Fert-Mac , Orne, Normandy. [ 10 ] They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings's father made strenuous efforts to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels; although advised his son's release was approved, there were lengthy delays, with little explanation. In frustration, Cummings's father wrote a letter to President Woodrow Wilson in December 1917. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, returning to his family in the U.S. by New Year's Day, 1918. Cummings, his father, and Brown's family continued to agitate for Brown's release. By mid-February, he, too, was America-bound. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, The Enormous Room (1922), about which F. Scott Fitzgerald said, ""Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives The Enormous Room by E. E. Cummings ... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."" [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served a training deployment [ 9 ] in the 12th Division at Camp Devens, Massachusetts , until November 1918. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Buffalo Bill's defunct who used to ride a watersmooth-silver stallion and break onetwothreefourfive pigeonsjustlikethat Jesus he was a handsome man and what i want to know is how do you like your blueeyed boy Mister Death "" Buffalo Bill's "" (1920) [ a ] Post-war years [ edit ] Cummings returned to Paris in 1921, and lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection Tulips and Chimneys , was published in 1923, and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. XLI Poems was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant-garde poet. [ 9 ] During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the Soviet Union , recounting his experiences in Eimi , published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and Mexico , and he worked as an essayist and portrait artist for Vanity Fair magazine (19241927). [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 1926, Cummings's parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his i: six nonlectures series given at Harvard (as part of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures ) in 1952 and 1953: [ 20 ] [ 21 ] A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing  dazed but erect  beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.  E. E. Cummings (1952). ""i  my parents: Nonlecture one"", p. 12 His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem ""my father moved through dooms of love"". [ b ] [ 23 ] In the 1930s, Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings's publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher. [ 24 ] Final years [ edit ] Grave of E. E. Cummings In 1952, his alma mater, Harvard University , awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as i: six nonlectures . [ 25 ] i thank You God for most this amazing day: for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and a blue true dream of sky; and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes  From ""i thank You God for most this amazing"" (1950) [ c ] Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, Joy Farm , in Silver Lake, New Hampshire . He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 at Memorial Hospital in North Conway, New Hampshire . [ 27 ] Cummings was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Cummings was recognized as the ""second most widely read poet in the United States, after Robert Frost "". [ 28 ] Cummings's papers are held at the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin . [ 10 ] Personal life [ edit ] Marriages [ edit ] Sketched self-portrait circa 1920 Cummings was married twice: first to Elaine Orr Thayer in 1924, then to Anne Minnerly Barton in 1929. His longest relationship, with Marion Morehouse, began in 1934, and lasted more than three decades. [ 29 ] In 1917, before his first marriage, Cummings shared several passionate love letters with a Parisian prostitute, Marie Louise Lallemand. [ 30 ] Despite Cummings's efforts, he was unable to find Lallemand upon his return to Paris after serving at the front. [ 30 ] Cummings's relationship with Elaine Orr began as a love affair in 1918, while she was still married to Scofield Thayer , one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time, he wrote a large portion of his erotic poetry. [ 26 ] [ 31 ] The couple had a daughter while Orr was still married to Thayer. After Orr divorced Thayer, Cummings and Orr married on March 19, 1924. Thayer had been registered on the child's birth certificate as the father, but Cummings legally adopted her after his marriage to Orr. Although his relationship with Orr stretched back several years, the marriage was brief. On a trip to Paris, Orr met and fell in love with the Irish nobleman, future politician, author, journalist, and former banker Frank MacDermot . The couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later. [ 9 ] [ 29 ] [ 32 ] Cummings married his second wife, Anne Minnerly Barton, on May 1, 1929. They separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Minnerly obtained a Mexican divorce ; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72. [ 29 ] In 1934, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. It is not clear whether the two were ever formally married. Morehouse lived with Cummings until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969, [ 33 ] while living at 4 Patchin Place , Greenwich Village , New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924. [ 34 ] Political views [ edit ] According to his testimony in EIMI , Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931. [ 35 ] He subsequently shifted rightward on many political and social issues. [ 36 ] Despite his radical and bohemian public image, he was a Republican and later an ardent supporter of Joseph McCarthy . [ 37 ] Literary overview [ edit ] This section has multiple issues.

( August 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Poetry [ edit ] As well as being influenced by notable modernists , including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound , Cummings was particularly drawn to early imagist experiments; later, his visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and Surrealism , which was reflected in his writing style. [ 38 ] Cummings critic and biographer Norman Friedman remarks that in Cummings's later work the ""shift from simile to symbol"" created poetry that is ""frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier"". [ 39 ] Despite Cummings's familiarity with avant-garde styles (likely affected by the calligrams of French poet Apollinaire , according to a contemporary observation [ 40 ] ), much of his work  draws inspiration from traditional forms. For example, many of his poems are sonnets , albeit described by Richard D. Cureton as ""revisionary ... with scrambled rhymes and rearranged, disproportioned structures; awkwardly unpredictable metrical variation; clashing, mawkish diction; complex, wandering syntax; etc."" [ 41 ] He occasionally drew from the blues form and used acrostics . Many of Cummings's poems are satirical and address social issues [ d ] but have an equal or even stronger bias toward Romanticism : time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth. [ 42 ] [ e ] While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the Romantic tradition, critic Emily Essert asserts that Cummings's work is particularly modernist and frequently employs what linguist Irene Fairley calls "" syntactic deviance"". [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Some poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones; many of the poems he is best known for, however, do possess a stylistic typography he made his own, particularly in his insistent use of the lower case 'i'. i carry your heart with me(i carry it in my heart)i am never without it(anywhere i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done by only me is your doing,my darling) i fear no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true) and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you here is the deepest secret nobody knows (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows higher than soul can hope or mind can hide) and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart) From ""i carry your heart with me(i carry it in"" (1952) [ f ] While some of his poetry is free verse (and not beheld to rhyme or meter ), Cureton has remarked that many of his sonnets follow an intricate rhyme scheme, and often employ pararhyme . [ 41 ] A number of Cummings's poems feature his typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, wherein Essert asserts ""feeling is first"" and the work begs to ""be re-read in order to be understood""; [ 43 ] Cummings, also a painter, created his texts not just as literature, but as ""visual objects"" on the page, and used typography to ""paint a picture"". [ 9 ] [ 45 ] The seeds of Cummings's unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father: [ 46 ] FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD, HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN, FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR, LOVE, YOU DEAR, ESTLIN. Following his autobiographical novel, The Enormous Room , Cummings's first published work was a collection of poems titled Tulips and Chimneys (1923). This early work already displayed Cummings's characteristically eccentric use of grammar and punctuation, although a fair amount of the poems are written in conventional language. [ 9 ] anyone lived in a pretty how town (with up so floating many bells down) spring summer autumn winter he sang his didn't he danced his did Women and men (both little and small) cared for anyone not at all they sowed their isn't they reaped their same sun moon stars rain From "" anyone lived in a pretty how town "" (1940) [ g ] Cummings's works often do not follow the conventional rules that generate typical English sentences, or what Fairley identifies as ""ungrammar"". [ 44 ] In addition, a number of Cummings's poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. [ 48 ] Cummings also employs what Fairley describes as "" morphological innovation"", wherein he frequently creates what critic Ian Landles calls: ""unusual compounds suggestive of 'a child's language'"" like ""'mud-luscious' and 'puddle-wonderful'"". [ 44 ] [ 49 ] Literary critic R. P. Blackmur has commented that this use of language is ""frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favor of merely private and personal associations"". [ 50 ] Fellow poet Edna St. Vincent Millay , in her equivocal letter recommending Cummings for the Guggenheim Fellowship he was awarded in 1934, expressed her frustration at his opaque symbolism. ""[I]f he prints and offers for sale poetry which he is quite content should be, after hours of sweating concentration, inexplicable from any point of view to a person as intelligent as myself, then he does so with a motive which is frivolous from the point of view of art, and should not be helped or encouraged by any serious person or group of persons ... there is fine writing and powerful writing (as well as some of the most pompous nonsense I ever let slip to the floor with a wide yawn) ... What I propose, then, is this: that you give Mr. Cummings enough rope. He may hang himself; or he may lasso a unicorn."" [ 51 ] Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip Krazy Kat . [ 52 ] Cummings included ethnic slurs in his writing, which proved controversial. In his 1950 collection Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems , Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters. Friedman considered these two poems to be ""condensed"" and ""cryptic"" parables, ""sparsely told"", in which setting the use of such ""inflammatory material"" was likely to meet with reader misapprehension. Poet William Carlos Williams spoke out in his defense. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] one day a nigger caught in his hand a little star no bigger than not to understand ""i'll never let you go until you've made me white"" so she did and now stars shine at night. a kike is the most dangerous machine as yet invented by even yankee ingenu ity(out of a jew a few dead dollars and some twisted laws) it comes both prigged and canted no. 24, from Xaipe (1950) no. 46, from Xaipe (1950) Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy: [ 53 ] Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. ""America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky'  Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square-head') is to blame for 'kike,'"" he said. Plays [ edit ] During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. HIM , a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the Provincetown Players in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are ""Him"", a playwright, portrayed by William Johnstone , and ""Me"", his girlfriend, portrayed by Erin O'Brien-Moore . Cummings said of the unorthodox play: [ 56 ] Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuffrelax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. ... Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU. "" Anthropos, or the Future of Art is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium . The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three ""infrahumans"", or inferior beings. The word anthropos is the Greek word for ""man"", in the sense of ""mankind"". Tom, A Ballet is a ballet based on Uncle Tom's Cabin . The ballet is detailed in a ""synopsis"" as well as descriptions of four ""episodes"", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It remained unperformed until 2015. [ 57 ] Santa Claus: A Morality was probably Cummings's most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, Wake . The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus's family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus's faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child. Art [ edit ] Cummings was an avid painter, referring to writing and painting as his twin obsessions [ 58 ] and to himself as a poetandpainter. [ 59 ] He painted continuously, relentlessly, from childhood until his death, and left in his estate more than 1600 oils and watercolors (a figure that does not include the works he sold during his career) and over 9,000 drawings. [ 59 ] In a self-interview from Foreword to an Exhibit: II (1945), the artist asked himself, Tell me, doesn't your painting interfere with your writing? and answered, Quite the contrary: they love each other dearly. [ 60 ] Cummings had more than 30 exhibits of his paintings in his lifetime. [ 59 ] He received substantial acclaim as an American cubist and an abstract, avant garde painter between the World Wars, but with the publication of his books The Enormous Room and Tulips and Chimneys in the 1920s, his reputation as a poet eclipsed his success as a visual artist. [ 59 ] In 1931, he published a limited edition volume of his artwork entitled CIOPW , named for his media of charcoal, ink, oil, pencil, and watercolor. About this same time, he began to break from Modernist aesthetics and employ a more subjective and spontaneous style; [ 59 ] his work became more representational: landscapes, nudes, still lifes, and portraits. [ 61 ] Name and capitalization [ edit ] Cummings's publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional orthography in his poetry by writing his name in lower case. [ 62 ] Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals. [ 62 ] The use of lower case for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings ""had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case"". [ 25 ] According to Cummings's widow, however, this is incorrect. [ 62 ] She wrote to Friedman: ""You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid  childish statement about Cummings  his signature."" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on. [ 63 ] One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lower case, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use. [ 62 ] Additionally, The Chicago Manual of Style , which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalization of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes ""E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name."" [ 64 ] Adaptations [ edit ] In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer, Jean Erdman presented ""The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell"" with a commissioned score by John Cage and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the Arts Club of Chicago . Erdman also choreographed ""Twenty Poems"" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings's poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by Teiji Ito . It was performed in the round at the Circle in the Square Theatre in Greenwich Village. Numerous composers have set Cummings's poems to music: In 1970, Pierre Boulez composed Cummings ist der Dichter ('cummings is the Poet') from poems by E. E. Cummings. [ 65 ] Aribert Reimann set Cummings to music in ""Impression IV"" (1961) for soprano and piano. [ 66 ] Italian composer Luciano Berio 's 1960 composition Circles is a setting of three poems by E. E. Cummings, including the poems ""Stinging"", ""Riverly Is a Flower"", and ""N(o)w"". [ 67 ] Morton Feldman (19261987) in 1951 composed ""4 Songs to e.e. cummings"" for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings's 50 Poems of 1940: ""!Blac"", ""Air"", ""(Sitting In A Tree-)"" and ""(Moan)"". The Icelandic singer Bjrk used lines from Cummings's poem ""I Will Wade Out"" for the lyrics of ""Sun in My Mouth"" on her 2001 album Vespertine . On her next album, Medlla (2004), Bjrk used his poem ""It May Not Always Be So"" as the lyrics for the song ""Sonnets/Unrealities XI"". The American composer Eric Whitacre wrote a cycle of works for choir titled The City and the Sea , which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music. He also wrote music for ""little tree"" and ""i carry your heart"", among others. Others who have composed settings for his poems include, among many others: [ 68 ] Dominic Argento William Bergsma Leonard Bernstein Marc Blitzstein John Cage Romeo Cascarino Aaron Copland Serge de Gastyne David Diamond John Duke Margaret Garwood Daron Hagen Michael Hedges Timothy Hoekman Richard Hundley Barbara Kolb Leonard Lehrman Robert Manno Salvatore Martirano William Mayer John Musto Paul Nordoff Tobias Picker Vincent Persichetti Ned Rorem Peter Schickele Elie Siegmeister Ann Loomis Silsbee Aki Takase Hugo Weisgall Dan Welcher James Yannatos Matthew Peterson Awards [ edit ] During his lifetime, Cummings received numerous awards in recognition of his work, including: Dial Award (1925) [ 9 ] Guggenheim Fellowship (1933) [ 69 ] Shelley Memorial Award for Poetry (1945) [ 70 ] Harriet Monroe Prize from Poetry magazine (1950) [ 71 ] Fellowship of American Academy of Poets (1950) [ 28 ] Guggenheim Fellowship (1951) [ 69 ] Charles Eliot Norton Professorship at Harvard (19521953) [ 28 ] Special citation from the National Book Award Committee for his Poems, 19231954 (1957) Bollingen Prize in Poetry (1958) [ 28 ] Boston Arts Festival Award (1957) Two-year Ford Foundation grant of 15,000 (1959) [ 28 ] Books [ edit ] ""the hours rise up"" on a wall in Leiden Prose books [ edit ] The Enormous Room (1922) EIMI (1933), Soviet travelogue Fairy Tales (1965), collection of short stories Poetry [ edit ] Tulips and Chimneys (1923)  (1925), self-published XLI Poems (1925) is 5 (1926) ViVa (1931) No Thanks (1935) Collected Poems (1938) 50 Poems (1940) 1  1 (1944) XAIPE: Seventy-One Poems (1950) Poems, 19231954 (1954) 95 Poems (1958) Selected Poems 1923-1958 (1960) 73 Poems (1963, posthumous) Etcetera: The Unpublished Poems (1983) Complete Poems, 19041962 , edited by George James Firmage (2008), Liveright Erotic Poems , edited by George James Firmage (2010), Norton Plays [ edit ] HIM (1927) Santa Claus: A Morality (1946) Collections [ edit ] CIOPW (1931), art works isix nonlectures (1953), Harvard University Press References [ edit ] Poems cited [ edit ] Full text of poetry available at:  ""Buffalo Bill's"" available at the Poetry Foundation  ""my father moved through dooms of love"", via Berkeley [ 22 ]  See: Selected works (1994) [ 26 ] : 167  For example, ""why must itself up every of a park""  For example, ""[anyone lived in a pretty how town]""  ""i carry your heart with me(i carry it in"" at the Poetry Foundation .

A variable is considered empty if it does not exist or if its value equals false . empty() does not generate a warning if the variable does not exist. Parameters var Variable to be checked No warning is generated if the variable does not exist.        That means empty() is essentially the        concise equivalent to !isset(var)  var  false .        This also applies to nested structures, such as a multidimensional array or chained properties. Return Values Returns true if var does not exist or has a value that is empty or equal to zero,    aka falsey, see conversion to boolean .    Otherwise returns false . Examples Example 1       A simple empty() / isset() comparison. ?php var  0 ; // Evaluates to true because var is empty if (empty( var ))  echo 'var is either 0, empty, or not set at all' ;  // Evaluates as true because var is set if (isset( var ))  echo 'var is set even though it is empty' ;  ? Example 2 empty() on String Offsets ?php expected_array_got_string  'somestring' ; var_dump (empty( expected_array_got_string [ 'some_key' ])); var_dump (empty( expected_array_got_string [ 0 ])); var_dump (empty( expected_array_got_string [ '0' ])); var_dump (empty( expected_array_got_string [ '0.5' ])); var_dump (empty( expected_array_got_string [ '0 Mostel' ])); ? The above example will output: bool(true) bool(false) bool(false) bool(true) bool(true) Example 3 empty() on multidimensional arrays ?php multidimensional  [ 'some'  [ 'deep'  [ 'nested'  'value' ] ] ]; if (!empty( multidimensional [ 'some' ][ 'some' ][ 'nested' ]))  someVariable  multidimensional [ 'some' ][ 'deep' ][ 'nested' ];  var_dump (empty( multidimensional [ 'some-undefined-key' ])); var_dump (empty( multidimensional [ 'some' ][ 'deep' ][ 'unknown' ])); var_dump (empty( multidimensional [ 'some' ][ 'deep' ][ 'nested' ])); ? The above example will output: bool(true) bool(true) bool(false) Notes Note : Because this is a language construct and not a function, it cannot be called using variable functions , or named arguments . Note : When using empty() on inaccessible object properties,     the __isset() overloading method will be called, if declared. See Also isset() - Determine if a variable is declared and is different than null __isset() unset() - Unset a given variable array_key_exists() - Checks if the given key or index exists in the array count() - Counts all elements in an array or in a Countable object strlen() - Get string length The type comparison tables Found A Problem?

Consider this example: ?php class Registry  protected _items  array(); public function __set ( key , value )  this - _items [ key ]  value ;  public function __get ( key )  if (isset( this - _items [ key ]))  return this - _items [ key ];  else  return null ;    registry  new Registry (); registry - empty  '' ; registry - notEmpty  'not empty' ; var_dump (empty( registry - notExisting )); // true, so far so good var_dump (empty( registry - empty )); // true, so far so good var_dump (empty( registry - notEmpty )); // true, .. say what? tmp  registry - notEmpty ; var_dump (empty( tmp )); // false as expected ? The result for empty(registry-notEmpty) is a bit unexpeced as the value is obviously set and non-empty. This is due to the fact that the empty() function uses __isset() magic functin in these cases. Although it's noted in the documentation above, I think it's worth mentioning in more detail as the behaviour is not straightforward. In order to achieve desired (expexted?) results, you need to add  __isset() magic function to your class: ?php class Registry  protected _items  array(); public function __set ( key , value )  this - _items [ key ]  value ;  public function __get ( key )  if (isset( this - _items [ key ]))  return this - _items [ key ];  else  return null ;   public function __isset ( key )  if (isset( this - _items [ key ]))  return ( false  empty( this - _items [ key ]));  else  return null ;    registry  new Registry (); registry - empty  '' ; registry - notEmpty  'not empty' ; var_dump (empty( registry - notExisting )); // true, so far so good var_dump (empty( registry - empty )); // true, so far so good var_dump (empty( registry - notEmpty )); // false, finally! ? It actually seems that empty() is returning negation of the __isset() magic function result, hence the negation of the empty() result in the __isset() function above. up down 68 steven at nevvix dot com  13 years ago When you need to accept these as valid, non-empty values: - 0 (0 as an integer) - 0.0 (0 as a float) - ""0"" (0 as a string) ?php function is_blank ( value )  return empty( value )  ! is_numeric ( value );  ? This is similar to Rails' blank? method. up down 4 mmulej at gmail dot com  2 years ago Tests on - Win 11 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU  2.20GHz   2.21 GHz - 64Gb RAM, - PHP 8.1.10 (in Tinkerwell) repeatedly show empty  count   [], but the margin is small and not worth the micro-optimizations.

I don't know if there is a standard way to test for ""empty"" objects, I personally use array casting: ?php var  new stdClass (); // ""empty"" object var  (array) var ; // cast to empty array var_dump (empty( var )); // bool(true) ? up down 12 tom at tomwardrop dot com  16 years ago In reply to ""admin at ninthcircuit dot info"", Using str_replace is unnecessary. I would encourage the use of trim which would most likely be faster (haven't tested) and easier. Trim also takes care of other white space like line breaks and tabs. Actually, in most of the applications I code, I use a multi-dimensional array map function with trim on the Super Globals such as _POST, _GET and _COOKIE as so far, there hasn't been an instance where I would want any user input to begin or end with whitespace. The good thing about doing this is that you never have to worry about 'trimming' your input which makes your code easier and more reliable (incase you forget to trim some input). up down 11 info at ensostudio dot ru  3 years ago Multiple empty(): ?php /  Multiple empty().   param mixed[] vars Variables to test  return bool / function multi_empty ( ... vars )  // no callback is supplied, all empty values will be removed return array_filter ( vars )  [];  ? example: ?php notEmptyVar  1 ; emptyVar  null ; // undefinedVar - not defined multi_empty ( emptyVar ); // true multi_empty ( emptyVar , undefinedVar ); // true multi_empty ( notEmptyVar , emptyVar ); // false multi_empty ( notEmptyVar , emptyVar , undefinedVar ); // false ? up down 16 chrisdmiddleton at gmail dot com  10 years ago If you want to use empty() to evaluate an expression (not a variable), and you don't have PHP 5.5, you can do it by wrapping the call to empty in a function, like so: ?php function is_empty ( var )  return empty( var );  ? Then you can do something like ?php if( is_empty ( NULL ))  / ... /  ? without issue, since the local variable var is being tested rather than the expression in the function call itself. up down 5 wranvaud at gmail dot com  7 years ago Note that if your variable only has an ""end of line"" (aka carriage return), PHP_EOL it is not considered as empty. Since end of lines are not always easy to spot this can be confusing. up down 16 your dot brother dot t at hotmail dot com  10 years ago (experienced in PHP 5.6.3) The empty() can't evaluate __get() results explicitly, so the empty() statement bellow always renders true ?php class Juice extends Liquid  protected apple ; protected orange ; public function __get ( name )  return this - name ;  public function __construct ( apple , orange )  this - apple  apple ; this - orange  orange ;   class Glass  protected liquid ; public function __get ( name )  return name  ""liquid"" ? this - liquid : false ;  public function __construct ()  this - juice  new Juice ( 3 , 5 );   glass  new Glass (); var_dump (empty( this - liquid - apple )); /  The output is:  bool(true) / ? The correct way is to force the evaluation of __get() first, by using extra braces around implicit statements like this: ?php var_dump (empty(( this - liquid - apple ))); /  The output is:  bool(false) / ? So if you are using packages that utilize object oriented designs and magic methods like __get(), it's a good practice to always use double braces for empty() calls. up down 9 markmanning at gmail dot com  6 years ago I normally count() an array, so I wanted to see how empty() would stack up. ?php test  array(); test2  array(); for ( x  0 ; x  1000 ; x ) test []  x ; ts  microtime ( true ); for ( x  0 ; x  100000000 ; x )  if ( count ( test ))    echo ""Time taken:  "" . ( microtime ( true ) - ts ) . "" secn"" ; ? For 100,000,000 comparisons, here are the results against PHP 7.2.16 on my hardware: count(test):  2.697 sec count(test2):  2.596 sec test  array():  2.579 sec test2  array():  2.552 sec empty(test):  3.085 sec empty(test2):  3.113 sec In short, it doesn't matter what method is used although empty() is actually just ever so slightly slower despite it being a language construct.  YMMV. up down 20 martin dot aarhof at gmail dot com  13 years ago ?php str  '            ' ; var_dump (empty( str )); // boolean false ? So remember to trim your strings first! ?php str  '        ' ; str  trim ( str ); var_dump (empty( str )); // boolean true ? up down 7 mlibazisi mabandla  15 years ago in cases when ""0"" is not intended to be empty, here is a simple function to safely test for an empty string (or mixed variable): ?php function _empty ( string ) string  trim ( string ); if(! is_numeric ( string )) return empty( string ); return FALSE ;  ? up down 10 aidan1103 at yahoo dot com  15 years ago empty() should not necessarily return the negation of the __isset() magic function result, if you set a data member to 0, isset() should return true and empty should also return true.  A simpler implementation of the __isset magic function would be: public function __isset(key)  return isset(this-key);  I don't understand why this isn't included in stdClass and inherited by default. up down 9 ehsmeng  14 years ago I can't use empty() in all situations because '0' is usually not considered empty to me. I did a quick benchmark over the most common ways of testing it. ''  var suffers from ''  0 is true so that's just there for curiosity. ?php microtimeref  microtime ( true ); a  0 ; b  'asd' ; for ( i  0 ; i  5000000 ; i )  if ( 0  mb_strlen ( b ))  a ;   echo ""Total time 0  mb_strlen(var): b"" . round ( microtime ( true ) - microtimeref , 3 ) . 's/bbr /' ; ? The results: Total time 0  mb_strlen(var): 3.141s Total time 0  strlen(var): 2.904s Total time 0  strlen(var): 2.878s Total time ''  var: 1.774s Total time ''  var: 1.706s Total time empty(var): 1.496s Thus ''  var will be my zero length string test. up down 12 Anonymous  16 years ago To add on to what anon said, what's happening in john_jian's example seems unusual because we don't see the implicit typecasting going on behind the scenes.  What's really happening is: a  ''; b  0; c  '0'; (int)a  b - true, because any string that's not a number gets converted to 0 b(int)c - true, because the int in the string gets converted and ac - false, because they're being compared as strings, rather than integers.  (int)a(int)c should return true, however. Note: I don't remember if PHP even has typecasting, much less if this is the correct syntax.  I'm just using something for the sake of examples. up down 13 phpsort  14 years ago I'm summarising a few points on empty() with inaccessible properties, in the hope of saving others a bit of time. Using PHP 5.3.2. ?php class MyClass  private foo  'foo' ;  myClass  new MyClass ; echo myClass - foo ; ? As expected, this gives ""Fatal error: Cannot access private property MyClass::foo"". But substitute the line if (empty(myClass-foo)) echo 'foo is empty'; else echo 'foo is not empty'; and we get the misleading result ""foo is empty"". There is NO ERROR OR WARNING, so this is a real gotcha. Your code will just go wrong silently, and I would say it amounts to a bug. If you add two magic functions to the class: public function __get(var)  return this-var;  public function __isset(var)  return isset(this-var);  then we get the expected result. You need both functions. For empty(myClass-foo), I believe PHP calls __isset, and if that is true returns the result of empty on the result of __get. (Some earlier posts wrongly suggest PHP just returns the negation of __isset). BUT  See the earlier post by php at lanar dot com. I confirm those results, and if you extend the test with isset(x-a-b-c) it appears that __isset is only called for the last property in the chain. Arguably another bug. empty() behaves in the same way. So things are not as clear as we might hope. See also the note on empty() at http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php Clear as mud! up down 8 marko dot crni at gmail dot com  14 years ago Calling non existing object property, empty(object-prop), will trigger __isset(), the same way as isset(object-prop) does, but there is one difference. If __isset() returns TRUE, another call to __get() will be made and actual return value will be result of empty() and result of __get(). up down 9 paul at worldwithoutwalls dot co dot uk  20 years ago Note the exceptions when it comes to decimal numbers: ?php a  0.00 ; b  '0.00' ; echo (empty( a )? ""empty"" : ""not empty"" ); //result empty echo (empty( b )? ""empty"" : ""not empty"" ); //result not empty //BUT... c  intval ( b ); echo (empty( c )? ""empty"" : ""not empty"" ); //result empty ? For those of you using MySQL, if you have a table with a column of decimal type, when you do a SELECT, your data will be returned as a string, so you'll need to do apply intval() before testing for empty. e.g. TABLE t has columns id MEDIUMINT and d DECIMAL(4,2) and contains 1 row where id1, d0.00 ?php q  ""SELECT  FROM t"" ; res  mysql_query ( q ); row  mysql_fetch_assoc ( res ); echo (empty( row [ 'd' ])?

It is the same as an IF/ELSE check.  So, don't bother using EMPTY in the real world. This is NOT true.  empty() will not generate warnings if you're testing against an undefined variable as a simple boolean check will.  On production systems, warnings are usually shut off, but they are often active on development systems. You could test a flag with ?php if ( flagvar )  ... ? but this can generate a warning if flagvar is not set. Instead of ?php if (isset( flagvar )  flagvar )  ... ? you can simply use ?php if (!empty( flagvar ))  ... ? for easy readability without warnings. up down 10 chris dot wisefool at gmail dot com  13 years ago Note that checking the existence of a subkey of an array when that subkey does not exist but the parent does and is a string will return false for empty. i.e. ?php params  array( 'search'  '1' ); empty( params [ 'search' ][ 'filter' ]);  returns false ? This is correct, per the documentation ( http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php ); quite a bit down the page is the Warning: ""Writing to an out of range offset pads the string with spaces. Non-integer types are converted to integer."" ) I didn't receive a warning but perhaps that's correct too...depends on whether the string - integer conversion is considered ""illegal"": ""Illegal offset type emits E_NOTICE."" (i.e. since params['search'] is a string, the 'filter' subscript is converted to 0, so the test becomes empty(params['search'][0]), which is obviously false), but it tripped me up enough to mistakenly file a bug report (which I've since closed). up down 5 mcfogw at gmail dot com  8 years ago I'm comparing behavior of ! and empty(), find an undocumented behavior here. just like cast-to-boolean, empty() cares about if SimpleXML object is made from emty tags. empty(simplexml_load_string('root /')) is TRUE this behavior begins from php 5.1.07, in 5.0.x that's FALSE proof here  https://3v4l.org/74Tc4 up down 5 jmarbas at hotmail dot com  19 years ago empty(var) will return TRUE if var is empty (according to the definition of 'empty' above) AND if var is not set. I know that the statement in the ""Return Values"" section of the manual already says this in reverse: ""Returns FALSE if var has a non-empty and non-zero value."" but I was like ""Why is this thing returning TRUE for unset variables???""... oh i see now... Its supposed to return TRUE for unset variables!!! ?php ini_set ( 'error_reporting' , E_ALL ); ini_set ( 'display_errors' , '1' ); empty( var ); ? up down 5 e dot klerks at i-bytes dot nl  14 years ago To make an empty function, which only accepts arrays, one can use type-hinting: ?php // emptyArray :: [a] - Bool function emptyArray (array xs ) return empty( xs );  ? Type hinting is a good thing to use in your code, because it makes it more easy to reason about your code. Besides that, it automatically documents the code. up down 6 rodolphe dot bodeau at free dot fr  14 years ago Be careful, if ""0"" (zero as a string), 0 (zero as an integer) and -0 (minus zero as an integer) return true, ""-0"" (minus zero as a string (yes, I already had some customers that wrote -0 into a form field)) returns false. You need to cast your variable before testing it with the empty() function : ?php var  ""-0"" ; echo empty( var ); // returns false var  (int) var ; // casts var as an integer echo empty( vat ); // returns true ? up down 1 Lukas  2 years ago ?php // Difference of empty() vs. isset() testCase  array( 1  '' , 2  ' ' , 3  null , 4  array(), 5  false , 6  true , 7  '0' , 8  0 , ); foreach ( testCase as k  v )  echo ""br k  "" . strval ( v ) .

Instead of saying if (!empty(var))  // it's not empty  you can just say if (check_not_empty(var))  // it's not empty . If you want strings that only contain whitespace (such as tabs or spaces) to be treated as empty then do: check_not_empty(var, 1) If you want to check if a string IS empty then do: !check_not_empty(var). So, whenever you want to check if a form field both exists and contains a value just do: if (check_not_empty(_POST['foo'], 1)) no need to do if (isset()  !empty()) anymore ] up down 2 qeremy  13 years ago Simple solution for: ""Fatal error: Can't use function return value in write context in ..."" ?php function _empty ( val )  return empty( val );  ? up down 0 xzero at elite7hackers dot net  7 years ago Note that empty() will return false on null byte.

In order to start sorting the letters and to create words, just enter any given letter into the first input field at the top of the word generator. Then press ENTER or click GRAB IT. The results will then be listed according to your preferences, either sorted by length or sorted alphabetically. Please note that the results might not contain all the letters you have typed in. Words with These Letters Only  Using the optional Search Pattern Field Our Letter Sorting Word Generator gives you the possibility to make words from letters by using an optional pattern. There are two different kinds of characters that can be used here. First of all, you can use any letter you want to appear in the results. Please note that the letters in the pattern are used in addition to the letters you enter into the letter field. The letter E was typed into both the letter field and into the pattern field, which can lead to results with up to two Es inside. Make sure that you dont use letters that you do not have at your disposal. Making words from Letters and Dots The second kind of character that can be used to make words from letters is the dot (.). A single dot marks an optional empty field and represents possible letters in the words you want to create. Please note that if you use patterns, the results will be no longer than the number of characters you entered into the pattern field. So, always make sure to use plenty of dots here. If you dont type anything into the pattern field, there is no maximum length for the unscrambled words. If you want to make words from letters that consist of exactly for letters, use four dots in the pattern field, representing one letter with each dot. For more detailed information on how to use the pattern field, have a look at this tutorial on using patterns . No Pattern  Make words with these Letters only Leave the pattern field of our Word Maker empty and the words will be made exclusively from the letters you have typed into the letter field. Please keep in mind, there is a limit to 15 characters that you can type in. Yes Pattern  Make Words from Letters using Characters The Characters you can use in the pattern field are single DOTS, representing empty optional fields. You can also type in LETTERS, of course, and, finally NUMBERS to represent bonus fields in word games. Using Dots, Letters and Numbers in the Pattern Field The dots (.) represent optional empty fields that indicate the possible length of words. They serve as place holders for the letters, your words will eventually consist of. In addition to the LETTERS you typed into the pattern field, the DOTS will also make up for the variety of words possible. The NUMBERS represent the bonus fields for games like Scrabble or Words with Friends, for example double and triple letter bonus fields (numbers 2 and 3) and double or triple word bonus fields (numbers 4 and 5). Make Words from Letters and make them count! If you want to aim for high scoring words from your bouquet of letters that is BUTILIKEIT, you should make use of the numbers in the pattern field. The maximum word length in this example is limited to a total of eight letters. Each letter is represented by a single DOT. You may require for example the third letter of the word to be the highest scoring for a triple letter count, represented by the number 3 (indicated blue) and the sixth letter to be the highest scoring for a triple word count, represented by the number 5 (indicated red). The longest possible word here has no more than seven letters, still, the word generator provides you with the highest scoring words possible according to your preferences. Make words from Letters beginning with You can also search for words with specific letters at the beginning or at the end of each word. For example, you can search for 9-letter words with BE at the beginning. Simply type BE. into the pattern field, using a DOT for each following letter. Making Words from Letters with Other Letters in the Middle Think about the following set as an example:  Letters: ABCDEFG  Pattern: O.. In this example, all the words created will contain an O, with up to three letters before it and no more than two letters after it. Thus, the longest possible word will have six letters. In this case, the word maker will sort the letters to make words like ABODE, BEFOG and BOCA. As you can see, not all of the letters need to be used.

D342073	https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function.html	"What is a Function What is a Function? A function relates an input to an output. It is like a machine that has an input and an output. And the output is related somehow to the input. f(x) "" f(x)  ... "" is the classic way of writing a function. And there are other ways, as you will see! Input, Relationship, Output We will see many ways to think about functions, but there are always three main parts: The input The relationship The output Example: ""Multiply by 2"" is a very simple function. Here are the three parts: Input Relationship Output 0  2 0 1  2 2 7  2 14 10  2 20 ... ... ... For an input of 50, what is the output? Some Examples of Functions x 2 (squaring) is a function x 3 1 is also a function Sine, Cosine and Tangent are functions used in trigonometry and there are lots more! But we are not going to look at specific functions ... ... instead we will look at the general idea of a function. Names First, it is useful to give a function a name . The most common name is "" f "", but we can have other names like "" g "" ... or even "" marmalade "" if we want. But let's use ""f"": We say ""f of x equals x squared"" what goes into the function is put inside parentheses () after the name of the function: So f(x) shows us the function is called "" f "", and "" x "" goes in And we usually see what a function does with the input: f(x)  x 2 shows us that function "" f "" takes "" x "" and squares it. Example: with f(x)  x 2 : an input of 4 becomes an output of 16 In fact we can write f(4)  16 . The ""x"" is Just a Place-Holder! Don't get too concerned about ""x"", it is just there to show us where the input goes and what happens to it. It could be anything! So this function: f(x)  1  x  x 2 Is the same function as: f(q)  1  q  q 2 h(A)  1  A  A 2 w()  1     2 The variable (x, q, A, etc) is just there so we know where to put the values: f( 2 )  1  2  2 2  3 Sometimes There is No Function Name Sometimes a function has no name, and we see something like: y  x 2 But there is still: an input (x) a relationship (squaring) and an output (y) Relating At the top we said that a function was like a machine. But a function doesn't really have belts or cogs or any moving parts, and it doesn't actually destroy what we put into it! A function relates an input to an output. Saying "" f(4)  16 "" is like saying 4 is somehow related to 16. Or 4  16 Example: this tree grows 20 cm every year, so the height of the tree is related to its age using the function h : h (age)  age  20 So, if the age is 10 years, the height is: h (10)  10  20  200 cm Here are some example values: age h (age)  age  20 0 0 1 20 3.2 64 15 300 ... ... What Types of Things Do Functions Process? ""Numbers"" seems an obvious answer, but ... ... which numbers? For example, the tree-height function h (age)  age20 makes no sense for an age less than zero. ... it could also be letters (""A""""B""), or ID codes (""A6309""""Pass"") or stranger things. So we need something more powerful , and that is where sets come in: A set is a collection of things. Here are some examples: Set of even numbers: ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ... Set of clothes: ""hat"",""shirt"",... Set of prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ... Positive multiples of 3 that are less than 10: 3, 6, 9 Each individual thing in the set (such as ""4"" or ""hat"") is called a member , or element . So, a function takes elements of a set , and gives back elements of a set . A Function is Special But a function has special rules : It must work for every possible input value And it has only one relationship for each input value This can be said in one definition: Formal Definition of a Function A function relates each element of a set with exactly one element of another set (possibly the same set). The Two Important Things! 1. ""...each element..."" means that every element in X is related to some element in Y . We say that the function covers X (relates every element of it). (But some elements of Y might not be related to at all, which is fine.) 2. ""...exactly one..."" means that a function is single valued . It will not give back 2 or more results for the same input. So ""f(2)  7 or 9"" is not right! ""One-to-many"" is not allowed, but ""many-to-one"" is allowed: (one-to-many) (many-to-one) This is NOT OK in a function But this is OK in a function When a relationship does not follow those two rules then it is not a function ... it is still a relationship , just not a function. Example: The relationship x  x 2 Could also be written as a table: X: x Y: x 2 3 9 1 1 0 0 4 16 -4 16 ... ... It is a function , because: Every element in X is related to Y No element in X has two or more relationships So it follows the rules. (Notice how both 4 and -4 relate to 16 , which is allowed.) Example: This relationship is not a function: It is a relationship , but it is not a function , for these reasons: Value ""3"" in X has no relation in Y Value ""4"" in X has no relation in Y Value ""5"" is related to more than one value in Y (But the fact that ""6"" in Y has no relationship does not matter) Vertical Line Test On a graph, the idea of single valued means that no vertical line ever crosses more than one value. If it crosses more than once it is still a valid curve, but is not a function . Some types of functions have stricter rules, to discover more you can read Injective, Surjective and Bijective Infinitely Many My examples have just a few values, but functions usually work on sets with infinitely many elements. Example: y  x 3 The input set ""X"" is all Real Numbers The output set ""Y"" is also all the Real Numbers We can't show ALL the values, so here are just a few examples: X: x Y: x 3 -2 -8 -0.1 -0.001 0 0 1.1 1.331 3 27 and so on... and so on... Domain, Codomain and Range In our examples above the set ""X"" is called the Domain , the set ""Y"" is called the Codomain , and the set of elements that get pointed to in Y (the actual values produced by the function) is called the Range We have a special page on Domain, Range and Codomain if you want to know more. So Many Names! Functions have been used in mathematics for a very long time, and lots of different names and ways of writing functions have come about. Here are some common terms you should get familiar with: Example: z  2u 3 : ""u"" could be called the ""independent variable"" ""z"" could be called the ""dependent variable"" (it depends on the value of u) Example: f(4)  16 : ""4"" could be called the ""argument"" ""16"" could be called the ""value of the function"" Example: h(year)  20  year : h() is the function ""year"" could be called the ""argument"", or the ""variable"" For software ""year"" is called the parameter, and the value given to the parameter is called the variable! We often call a function ""f(x)"" when in fact the function is really ""f"" Ordered Pairs And here is another way to think about functions: Write the input and output of a function as an ""ordered pair"", such as (4,16). They are called ordered pairs because the input always comes first, and the output second: (input, output) So it looks like this: ( x , f(x) ) Example: (4,16) means that the function takes in ""4"" and gives out ""16"" Set of Ordered Pairs A function can then be defined as a set of ordered pairs: Example: (2,4), (3,5), (7,3) is a function that says ""2 is related to 4"", ""3 is related to 5"" and ""7 is related 3"". Also, notice that: the domain is 2,3,7 (the input values) and the range is 4,5,3 (the output values) But the function has to be single valued , so we also say ""if it contains (a, b) and (a, c), then b must equal c"" Which is just a way of saying that an input of ""a"" cannot produce two different results. Example: ( 2 , 4 ), ( 2 , 5 ), (7,3) is not a function because 2,4 and 2,5 means that 2 could be related to 4 or 5. In other words it is not a function because it is not single valued A Benefit of Ordered Pairs We can graph them... ... because they are also coordinates ! So a set of coordinates is also a function (if they follow the rules above, that is) A Function Can be in Pieces We can create functions that behave differently depending on the input value Example: A function with two pieces: when x is less than 0, it gives 5, when x is 0 or more it gives x 2 Here are some example values: x y -3 5 -1 5 0 0 2 4 4 16 ... ... Read more at Piecewise Functions . Explicit vs Implicit One last topic: the terms ""explicit"" and ""implicit"". Explicit is when the function shows us how to go directly from x to y, such as: y  x 3  3 When we know x, we can find y That is the classic y  f(x) style that we often work with. Implicit is when it is not given directly such as: x 2  3xy  y 3  0 When we know x, how do we find y? It may be hard (or impossible!) to go directly from x to y. ""Implicit"" comes from ""implied"", in other words shown indirectly . Graphing The Function Grapher can only handle explicit functions, The Equation Grapher can handle both types (but takes a little longer, and sometimes gets it wrong) Conclusion a function relates inputs to outputs a function takes elements from a set (the domain ) and relates them to elements in a set (the codomain ) all the outputs (the actual values related to) are together called the range a function is a special type of relation where: every element in the domain is included, and any input produces only one output (not this or that) an input and its matching output are together called an ordered pair so a function can also be seen as a set of ordered pairs 5571, 5572, 535, 5207, 5301, 1173, 7281, 533, 8414, 8430 Injective, Surjective and Bijective Domain, Range and Codomain Introduction to Sets Sets Index Copyright  2025 Rod Pierce"

[ 1 ] The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the single-storey (sometimes ""opentail"") and the double-storey (sometimes ""looptail"") . The former is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children. History For earlier history, see C  History . Egyptian Phoenician gaml Western Greek Gamma Etruscan C Old Latin C Latin G The evolution of the Latin alphabet's G can be traced back to the Latin alphabet's predecessor, the Greek alphabet . The voiced velar stop was represented by the third letter of the Greek alphabet, gamma () , which was later adopted by the Etruscan language . Latin then borrowed this ""rounded form"" of gamma, C, to represent the same sound in words such as recei , which was likely an early dative form of rex , meaning ""king"", as found in an ""early Latin inscription."" [ 2 ] Over time, however, the letter C shifted to represent the voiceless velar stop , leading to the displacement of the letter K. Scholars believe that this change can be attributed to the influence of the Etruscan language on Latin. [ 2 ] Afterwards, the letter 'G' was introduced in the Old Latin period as a variant of ' C ' to distinguish voiced // from voiceless /k/ , and G was used to represent a voiced velar stop from this point on and C ""stood for the unvoiced velar only"". [ 2 ] The recorded originator of 'G' is freedman Spurius Carvilius Ruga , who added letter G to the teaching of the Roman alphabet during the 3rd century BC: [ 3 ] he was the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, around 230 BC . At this time, ' K ' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both // and /k/ before open vowels, had come to express /k/ in all environments. Ruga's positioning of 'G' shows that alphabetic order related to the letters' values as Greek numerals was a concern even in the 3rd century BC. According to some records, the original seventh letter, 'Z', had been purged from the Latin alphabet somewhat earlier in the 3rd century BC by the Roman censor Appius Claudius , who found it distasteful and foreign. [ 4 ] Sampson (1985) suggests that: ""Evidently the order of the alphabet was felt to be such a concrete thing that a new letter could be added in the middle only if a 'space' was created by the dropping of an old letter."" [ 5 ] George Hempl proposed in 1899 that there never was such a ""space"" in the alphabet and that in fact 'G' was a direct descendant of zeta .  Zeta took shapes like  in some of the Old Italic scripts ; the development of the monumental form 'G' from this shape would be exactly parallel to the development of 'C' from gamma . He suggests that the pronunciation /k/  // was due to contamination from the also similar-looking 'K'. [ 6 ] Eventually, both velar consonants /k/ and // developed palatalized allophones before front vowels; consequently in today's Romance languages , c and g have different sound values depending on context (known as hard and soft C and hard and soft G ). Because of French influence, English language orthography shares this feature. Typographic variants Typographic variants include a double-storey and a single-storey g . The modern lowercase g has two typographic variants: the single-storey (sometimes ""opentail"") and the double-storey (sometimes ""looptail"") . The single-storey form derives from the majuscule (uppercase) form by raising the serif that distinguishes it from 'c' to the top of the loop (thus closing the loop), and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The double-storey form ( ) had developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a closed bowl or loop. In the double-storey version, a small top stroke in the upper-right, often terminating in an orb shape, is called an ""ear"". The loop-tail form is the original one, as seen in 9th century Carolingian script ; evolving over centuries of monastic copying , the open-tail variant came to predominate and it was this that Gutenberg adopted when creating the first Blackletter typefaces   until that in turn was replaced by Humanist minuscule , which reasserted the closed-tail form. [ 7 ] Generally, the two forms are complementary and interchangeable; the form displayed is a typeface selection choice. In Unicode , the two appearances are generally treated as glyph variants with no semantic difference. Most serif typefaces use the looptail form (for example, g ) and most sans-serif typefaces use the opentail form (for example, g ) but the code point in both cases is U0067. For applications where the single-storey variant must be distinguished (such as strict IPA in a typeface where the usual g character is double-storey), the character U0261  LATIN SMALL LETTER SCRIPT G is available, as well as an upper case version, UA7AC  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SCRIPT G . Occasionally the difference has been exploited to provide contrast. In the International Phonetic Alphabet , opentail   has always represented a voiced velar plosive , while looptail   represented a voiced velar fricative from 1895 to 1900. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] In 1948, the Council of the International Phonetic Association recognized    and   as typographic equivalents, [ 10 ] and this decision was reaffirmed in 1993. [ 11 ] While the 1949 Principles of the International Phonetic Association recommended the use of   for a velar plosive and    for an advanced one for languages where it is preferable to distinguish the two, such as Russian, [ 12 ] this practice never caught on. [ 13 ] The 1999 Handbook of the International Phonetic Association , the successor to the Principles , abandoned the recommendation and acknowledged both shapes as acceptable variants. [ 14 ] In 2018, a study found that native English speakers have little conscious awareness of the looptail form ( ). The authors write: ""Despite being questioned repeatedly, and despite being informed directly that G has two lowercase print forms, nearly half of the participants failed to reveal any knowledge of the looptail 'g', and only 1 of the 38 participants was able to write looptail 'g' correctly"".

Alone, it represents a voiced velar plosive ( // or ""hard"" g ), as in goose , gargoyle , and game ; a voiced palato-alveolar affricate ( /d/ or ""soft"" g ), predominates before i , e or y , as in giant , ginger , and geology ; or a voiced palato-alveolar sibilant ( // ) in post-medieval loanwords from French, such as rouge , beige , genre (often), and margarine (rarely) g is predominantly soft before e (including the digraphs ae and oe ), i , or y , and hard otherwise. It is hard in those derivations from  (gyn) meaning woman where initial-worded as such. Soft g is also used in many words that came into English from medieval church/academic use, French, Spanish, Italian or Portuguese  these tend to, in other ways in English, closely align to their Ancient Latin and Greek roots (such as fragile , logic or magic ). There remain widely used a few English words of non-Romance origin where g is hard followed by e or i ( get , give , gift , gig , girl , giggle ), and very few in which g is soft though followed by a such as gaol , which since the 20th century is almost always written as ""jail"". The double consonant  gg  has the value // (hard g ) as in nugget , with very few exceptions: /d/ in exaggerate and veggies and dialectally /d/ in suggest . The digraph  dg  has the value /d/ (soft g ), as in badger . Non-digraph dg can also occur, in compounds like floodgate and headgear . The digraph  ng  may represent: a velar nasal ( /  / ) as in length , singer the latter followed by hard g ( // ) as in jungle , finger , longest Non-digraph ng also occurs, with possible values /n/ as in engulf , ungainly /nd/ as in sponge , angel /n/ as in melange The digraph  gh  (in many cases a replacement for the obsolete letter yogh , which took various values including // , // , /x/ and /j/ ) may represent: // as in ghost , aghast , burgher , spaghetti /f/ as in cough , laugh , roughage  (no sound) as in through , neighbor , night /x/ in ugh (rarely) /p/ in hiccough (rarely) /k/ in s'ghetti Non-digraph gh also occurs, in compounds like foghorn , pigheaded . The digraph  gn  may represent: /n/ as in gnostic , deign , foreigner , signage /nj/ in loanwords like champignon , lasagna Non-digraph gn also occurs, as in signature , agnostic . The trigraph ngh has the value // as in gingham or dinghy . Non-trigraph ngh also occurs, in compounds like stronghold and dunghill . G is the tenth least frequently used letter in the English language (after Y , P , B , V , K , J , X , Q , and Z ), with a frequency of about 2.02 in words. Other languages Most Romance languages and some Nordic languages also have two main pronunciations for g , hard and soft. While the soft value of g varies in different Romance languages ( // in French and Portuguese , [(d)] in Catalan , /d/ in Italian and Romanian , and /x/ in most dialects of Spanish ), in all except Romanian and Italian, soft g has the same pronunciation as the j . In Italian and Romanian, gh is used to represent // before front vowels where g would otherwise represent a soft value. In Italian and French,  gn  is used to represent the palatal nasal // , a sound somewhat similar to the ny in English canyon . In Italian, the trigraph gli , when appearing before a vowel or as the article and pronoun gli , represents the palatal lateral approximant // . Other languages typically use g to represent // , regardless of position. Amongst European languages, Czech , Dutch , Estonian and Finnish are exceptions, as they do not have // in their native words. In Dutch , g represents a voiced velar fricative // instead, a sound that does not occur in modern English, but there is a dialectal variation: many Netherlandic dialects use a voiceless fricative ( [x] or [] ) instead, and in southern dialects it may be palatal [] . Nevertheless, word-finally, it is always voiceless in all dialects, including the standard Dutch of Belgium and the Netherlands. On the other hand, some dialects (like Amelands ) may have a phonemic // . Faroese uses g to represent /d/ , in addition to // , and also uses it to indicate a glide . In Mori , g is used in the digraph ng which represents the velar nasal // and is pronounced like the ng in singer . The Samoan and Fijian languages use the letter g by itself for // . In older Czech and Slovak orthographies, g was used to represent /j/ , while // was written as  ( g with caron ). The Azerbaijani Latin alphabet uses g exclusively for the ""soft"" sound, namely // . The sound // is written as q . This leads to unusual spellings of loanwords: qram 'gram', qrup 'group', qaraj 'garage', qallium 'gallium'.

ISO basic Latin alphabet Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz v t e J , or j , is the tenth letter of the Latin alphabet , used in the modern English alphabet , the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its usual name in English is jay (pronounced /  d e /  ), with a now-uncommon variant jy /  d a / . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] When used in the International Phonetic Alphabet for the voiced palatal approximant (the sound of ""y"" in ""yes"") it may be called yod or jod (pronounced /  j  d / or /  j o d / ). [ 4 ] History [ edit ] Egyptian hieroglyph  Phoenician Yodh Western Greek Iota Etruscan I Latin I Latin J Children's book from 1743, showing I and J considered as the same letter The letter J used to be used as the swash letter I , used for the letter I at the end of Roman numerals when following another I, as in XXIIJ or xxiij instead of XXIII or xxiii for the Roman numeral twenty-three. A distinctive usage emerged in Middle High German . [ 5 ] Gian Giorgio Trissino (14781550) was the first to explicitly distinguish I and J as representing separate sounds, in his pistola del Trissino de le lettere nuvamente aggiunte ne la lingua italiana (""Trissino's epistle about the letters recently added in the Italian language "") of 1524. [ 6 ] Originally, 'I' and 'J' were different shapes for the same letter, both equally representing /i/ , /i/ , and /j/ ; however, Romance languages developed new sounds (from former /j/ and // ) that came to be represented as 'I' and 'J'; therefore, English J, acquired from the French J, has a sound value quite different from /j/ (which represents the initial sound in the English language word "" y et""). Use in writing systems [ edit ] Pronunciation of j by language Orthography Phonemes Afrikaans / j / Albanian / j / Arabic romanization / d / or /  / Azeri /  / Basque / d / , / j / , /  / , /  / , / x / , /  / Cantonese ( Yale ) / ts / Cantonese ( Jyutping ) / j / Catalan /  / Standard Chinese ( Pinyin ) / t / Standard Chinese ( WadeGiles ) /  / Czech / j / Danish / j / Dutch / j / English / d / Esperanto / j / or / i / Estonian / j / Filipino / d / , / h / Finnish / j / French /  / German / j / Greenlandic / j / Hindi ( Hunterian ) / d / Hokkien ( Peh-e-j , Ti-l ) / dz /  / d / , / z /  /  / Hungarian / j / Icelandic / j / Igbo / d / Indonesian / d / Italian / j / Japanese ( Hepburn ) /  / , / d / Khmer ( ALA-LC ) / c / Kiowa / t / Konkani (Roman) /  / Korean ( RR ) / ts /  / t / , / dz /  / d / Kurdish /  / Luxembourgish / j / , /  / Latvian / j / Lithuanian / j / Malay / d / Maltese / j / Manx / d / Norwegian / j / Oromo / d / Pashto romanization / d / Polish / j / Portuguese /  / Romanian /  / Scots / d / Serbo-Croatian / j / Shona / d / Slovak / j / Slovenian / j / Somali / d / Spanish / x /  / h / Swahili /  / Swedish / j / Tamil romanization / d / Tatar /  / Telugu romanization / d / Turkish /  / Turkmen / d / Urdu ( Roman ) / d / Yoruba /  / Zulu / d / English [ edit ] In English, j most commonly represents the affricate /d/ . In Old English , /d/ was represented orthographically with c [ 7 ] (equivalent to cg , as  in Old English was simply the regular form of the letter G, called Insular G ). Middle English scribes began to use i (later j ) to represent word-initial /d/ under the influence of Old French , which had a similarly pronounced phoneme deriving from Latin /j/ (for example, i est and later j est ), while the same sound in other positions could be spelled as dg (for example, he dg e ). [ 7 ] The first English language books to make a clear distinction in writing between i and j were the King James Bible 1st Revision Cambridge 1629 and an English grammar book published in 1633. [ 8 ] Later, many other uses of i (later j ) were added in loanwords from French and other languages (e.g. ad j oin , j unta ). In loanwords such as bijou or Dijon , j may represent // , as in modern French. In some loanwords, including raj , Azerbaijan , Taj Mahal and Beijing , the regular pronunciation /d/ is actually closer to the native pronunciation, making the use of // an instance of hyperforeignism , a type of hypercorrection . [ 9 ] Occasionally, j represents its original /j/ sound, as in Hallelujah and fjord . In words of Spanish origin, such as jalapeo , English speakers usually pronounce j as the voiceless glottal fricative / h / , an approximation of the Spanish pronunciation of j (usually transcribed as a voiceless velar fricative [ x ] , although some varieties of Spanish use glottal [ h ] ). In English, j is the fourth least frequently used letter in words, being more frequent than only  z  ,  q  , and  x  . It is, however, quite common in proper nouns , especially personal names. Romance languages [ edit ] In the Romance languages , j has generally developed from its original palatal approximant value in Latin to some kind of fricative . In French , Portuguese , Catalan (except Valencian ), and Romanian it has been fronted to the postalveolar fricative /  / (like s in English mea s ure ). In Valencian and Occitan , it has the same sound as in English, / d / . In Spanish , by contrast, it has been both devoiced and backed from an earlier /  / to a present-day / x / or / h / , [ 10 ] with the actual phonetic realization depending on the speaker's dialect. j is not commonly used in modern standard Italian spelling. Only proper nouns (such as Jesi and Letojanni ), Latin words ( Juventus ), or words borrowed from foreign languages have j . The proper nouns and Latin words are pronounced with the palatal approximant / j / , while words borrowed from foreign languages tend to follow that language's pronunciation of j . Until the 19th century, j was used instead of non-syllabic i in word-initial and intervocalic positions (as in Savoja ) and as a replacement for final -ii ; this rule was quite strict in official writing. j is also used to render / j / in dialectal spelling, e.g. Romanesco dialect ajo [ajjo]] (garlic; cf. Italian aglio [ao] ). The Italian novelist Luigi Pirandello used j in vowel groups in his works written in Italian; he also wrote in his native Sicilian language , which still uses the letter j to represent / j / (and sometimes also [d] or [gj], depending on its environment). [ 11 ] Other European languages [ edit ] The great majority of Germanic languages , such as German , Dutch , Icelandic , Swedish , Danish and Norwegian , use j for the palatal approximant / j / , which is usually represented by the letter y in English. Other than English, notable exceptions are Scots , where it represents / d / , and Luxembourgish , where it represents both / j / and /  / . The letter also represents / j / in Albanian , the Uralic languages spoken in Europe, and those Slavic and Baltic languages that use the Latin alphabet, such as Polish , Czech , Serbo-Croatian , Slovak , Slovenian , Latvian and Lithuanian . Some related languages, such as Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian , also adopted j into the Cyrillic alphabet for the same purpose. The Maltese language , though a Semitic language , has been deeply influenced by the Romance languages (especially Sicilian), and also uses j for / j / . In Basque , the diaphoneme represented by j has a variety of realizations according to the regional dialect: [j, , , , , x] (the last one is typical of Gipuzkoa ). Other languages [ edit ] Among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin script , j stands for /  / in Turkish and Azerbaijani , for /  / in Tatar , and for / d / in Indonesian , Somali , Malay , Igbo , Shona , Oromo , Turkmen , and Zulu . It represents a voiced palatal plosive /  / in Konkani , Yoruba and Swahili . In Kiowa , j stands for a voiceless alveolar plosive, / t / . j stands for / d / in the romanization systems of most of the languages of India , such as Hindi and Telugu , and stands for / d / in the romanization of Japanese and Korean . For Chinese languages , j stands for / t / in the Mandarin Chinese pinyin system, the unaspirated equivalent of q ( / t / ). In WadeGiles , j stands for Mandarin Chinese /  / . Peh-e-j of Hokkien and Ti-l for Taiwanese Hokkien , j stands for / z / and /  / , or / dz / and / d / , depending on accents. In Cantonese , j stands for / j / in Jyutping and / ts / in Yale . The Royal Thai General System of Transcription does not use the letter j , although it is used in some proper names and non-standard transcriptions to represent either  [t] or  [t] (the latter following Pali / Sanskrit root equivalents). In romanized Pashto , j represents , pronounced [dz] . In Greenlandic and in the Qaniujaaqpait spelling of the Inuktitut language, j is used to transcribe / j / . Following Spanish usage, j represents [x] or similar sounds in many Latin-alphabet-based writing systems for indigenous languages of the Americas , such as [] in Mayan languages ( ALMG alphabet) and a glottal fricative [h] in some spelling systems used for Aymara . Other writing systems [ edit ] In the International Phonetic Alphabet ,  j  is used for the voiced palatal approximant , and a superscript  is used to represent palatalization . Other uses [ edit ] Main article: J (disambiguation) In international licence plate codes , J stands for Japan . In mathematics , j is one of the three imaginary units of quaternions . Also in mathematics , j is one of the three unit vectors. In the Metric system , J is the symbol for the joule , the SI derived unit for energy . In some areas of physics , electrical engineering and related fields, j is the symbol for the imaginary unit (the square root of 1) (in other fields, the letter i is used, but this would be ambiguous as it is also the symbol for current ).

Unicode also has a dotless variant,  (U0237). It is primarily used in Landsmlsalfabet and in mathematics. It is not intended to be used with diacritics since the normal j is softdotted in Unicode (that is, the dot is removed if a diacritic is to be placed above; Unicode further states that, for example, i    and the same holds true for j and ). [ 16 ] In Unicode, a duplicate of 'J' for use as a special phonetic character in historical Greek linguistics is encoded in the Greek script block as  (Unicode U03F3). It is used to denote the palatal glide /j/ in the context of Greek script. It is called ""Yot"" in the Unicode standard, after the German name of the letter J. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] An uppercase version of this letter was added to the Unicode Standard at U037F with the release of version 7.0 in June 2014. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Wingdings smiley issue [ edit ] In the Wingdings font by Microsoft , the letter ""J"" is rendered as a smiley face , sometimes creating confusion in emails after formatting is removed and a smiley turns back into an out-of-context ""J"". [ 21 ] (This is distinct from the Unicode code point U263A, which renders as ). In Microsoft applications, "":)"" is automatically replaced by a smiley rendered in a specific font face when composing rich text documents or HTML emails .

Its name in English is el (pronounced /   l /  EL ), plural els . [ 1 ] History Egyptian hieroglyph Phoenician lamedh Western Greek Lambda Etruscan L Latin L Lamedh may have come from a pictogram of an ox goad or cattle prod . Some have suggested that it represents a shepherd's staff. [ 2 ] Typographic variants """" redirects here. For the azimuthal quantum number, see Azimuthal quantum number . In most sans-serif typefaces, the lowercase letter ell l , written as the glyph l , may be difficult to distinguish from the uppercase letter ""eye""  I  (written as the glyph I ); in some serif typefaces, the glyph l may be confused with the glyph 1 , the digit one . To avoid such confusion, some newer computer fonts (such as Trebuchet MS ) have a finial , a curve to the right at the bottom of the lowercase letter ell . Other style variants are provided in script typefaces and display typefaces . All these variants of the letter are encoded in Unicode as U004C L LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L or U006C l LATIN SMALL LETTER L , allowing presentation to be chosen according to each context. For specialist mathematical and scientific use, there are a number of dedicated codepoints in the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols block . In the Romain du Roi , where the ascenders of lowercase letters have symmetrical serifs at the top, l has an extra serif to the left at the mean line to distinguish it from capital I . [ 3 ] Another means of reducing such confusion is to use symbol  , which is a cursive , handwriting-style lowercase form of the letter ""ell"". In Japan and Korea, for example, this is the symbol for the liter . (The International Committee for Weights and Measures recommends using L or l for the liter, [ 4 ] without specifying a typeface.) In Unicode , the cursive form is encoded as U2113  SCRIPT SMALL L from the "" letter-like symbols "" block. Unicode encodes an explicit symbol as U1D4C1  MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT SMALL L . [ 5 ] The TeX syntax mathell/math renders it as  displaystyle ell  . In mathematical formulas, an italic form (  ) of the script  is the norm. Use in writing systems Pronunciation of l by language Orthography Phonemes Standard Chinese ( Pinyin ) / l / English / l / , silent French / l / , silent German / l / Portuguese / l / Spanish / l / Turkish / l / , /  / English In English orthography , l usually represents the phoneme / l / , which can have several sound values, depending on the speaker's accent, and whether it occurs before or after a vowel. In Received Pronunciation , the alveolar lateral approximant (the sound represented in IPA by lowercase [l] ) occurs before a vowel, as in lip or blend , while the velarized alveolar lateral approximant (IPA [] ) occurs in bell and milk . This velarization does not occur in many European languages that use l ; it is also a factor making the pronunciation of l difficult for users of languages that lack l or have different values for it, such as Japanese or some southern dialects of Chinese . A medical condition or speech impediment restricting the pronunciation of l is known as lambdacism . In English orthography, l is often silent in such words as walk or could (though its presence can modify the preceding vowel letter's value), and it is usually silent in such words as palm and psalm ; however, there is some regional variation. L is the eleventh most frequently used letter in the English language. Other languages l usually represents the sound [l] or some other lateral consonant . Common digraphs include ll , which has a value identical to l in English, but has the separate value voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (IPA [] ) in Welsh , where it can appear in an initial position. In Spanish, ll represents // ( [] , [j] , [] , [] , or [] , depending on dialect). A palatal lateral approximant or palatal l (IPA [] ) occurs in many languages, and is represented by gli in Italian , ll in Spanish and Catalan , lh in Portuguese , and  in Latvian . In Turkish , l generally represents / l / , but represents /  / before a ,  , o , or u . In Washo , lower-case l represents a typical [l] sound, while upper-case L represents a voiceless [l] sound, a bit like double ll in Welsh . Other systems The International Phonetic Alphabet uses  l  to represent the voiced alveolar lateral approximant and a small cap    to represent the voiced velar lateral approximant . Other uses Main article: L (disambiguation) The capital letter L is used as the currency sign for the Albanian lek and the Honduran lempira . It was often used, especially in handwriting, as the currency sign for the Italian lira . Historically, it was commonly used as a currency sign for the British pound sterling (to abbreviate the Latin libra , a pound, see sd ); in modern usage, it has been overtaken by the pound sign (), which is based on L displaystyle mathfrak L , the blackletter form of the letter. In running text, its lower-case form (usually italicised ), l , was more often seen. [ a ] The Roman numeral L represents the number 50 . [ 7 ] In the International system of units , the liter (or litre) is abbreviated using a lower-case l or  , or an upper-case L . The latter form is used to avoid the risk of confusion between the letter l (el) and the numeral 1 (one) [ 4 ] (For , see above .) In watchmaking, the ligne (a traditional French measure of length still used in the industry) is abbreviated using an upper-case L. [ 8 ] In chemistry, L is used as a symbol for the Avogadro constant . [ 9 ] Related characters This article contains special characters .

You guessed it, I'm also childish and hate losing.   L ( ""One"" ) L (, Eru ) is a world-renowned detective who takes on the challenge of catching the mass murderer known as Kira . In his investigation, L becomes suspicious of Light Yagami and makes it his goal to prove that Light is Kira.

One of his most noticeable features is the shadow below each of his eyes, a result of him being an insomniac. L is always shown to be wearing a pair of blue jeans and a long-sleeved white shirt. He almost never wears shoes or socks, preferring to go barefoot, even while in public. This was shown when he visited Light Yagami's school and was seen barefoot while sitting on a bench, not bothering to wear his shoes until he got up to walk. L also tends to hunch over when walking. Character The ""L"" that L uses to represent himself L is quite secretive, and only communicates with the world through his assistant, Watari . He never shows his face to the world in person, instead representing himself with a capital letter L drawn in ""Old English MT"" or ""Cloister Black"" typeface. It is more likely to be ""Cloister Black"" as Watari's ""W"" is different in ""Old English MT."" After meeting the Japanese Task Force , he requests that the Task Force refer to him as ""Ryuzaki"" as an additional safety measure. In neither the manga nor the anime do the Task Force learn his true name. L is very intelligent, though his disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and many question his abilities upon viewing him. L tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He is good at deceiving his opponents, and is willing to take drastic measures to solve a case. Some of his tactics are quite bold, such as having death row inmate Lind L. Tailor pose as himself on live TV in order to draw out Kira, while others seem bizarre to those involved, such as handcuffing himself to suspected-Kira, Light Yagami. He is also shown to have a dry sense of humor, and he isn't above making sarcastic remarks to people. Although he tends to be polite, to some (such as Task Force member Shuichi Aizawa ), L can seem condescending at times. Using subterfuge, misinformation, disinformation, and an analytical knowledge of human nature to help lure a suspected murderer into a false sense of security and possibly make him carelessly over-confident, L sometimes gets what he wants through abnormal or possibly criminal channels. Whenever L gives percentages to indicate how much he suspects a person of committing a crime, such as ""five percent,"" he may in fact be over ninety percent convinced of their culpability. Although L tells Light that he is among the least likely suspects with one of the lowest percentages of probability, in reality, L is ""pretty certain"" that Light is Kira. As series writer Tsugumi Ohba said laughing, making light of L's tactics: ""The truth is, he's a liar."" L's preferred posture He also has several quirks, such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods (like desserts, candies and fruits) and holding items by using only a thumb and a finger. He also has an unusual way of sitting, with both of his feet on the chair. He claims that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40. Interestingly, in the manga, he is seen sitting on the floor in a pose similar to how one would meditate, while thinking deeply about the Kira case. He is often seen arranging objects and very intently stacking, or in other ways playing with, his staple food items. L is almost always encountered while performing actions that are considered inappropriate or rude in public. These actions/habits include biting fingernails, placing feet on furniture, slouching, chewing with an open mouth, talking with his mouth full, and calling out personal observations that may offend others. With his status as the world's greatest detective, he, like Light, has a very sensitive pride, being afraid to be wrong in his deductions and theories, evident through his drastic measures (torturing Misa and confining Light during an unnecessarily lengthy amount of time), and lethargic behavior during the beginning of the Yotsuba arc . Although he is often seen sitting and inactive, L retains a high athletic ability. L stayed in England for five years, and during that time, he was the tennis champion in the England Junior Cup. He also has a knack for martial arts, which is demonstrated in his brief fight with Light. In chapter 38 of the manga, L suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. L kicks Light When asked about L's ethnicity, creator of the series Tsugumi Ohba responded, ""I think of him as a quarter Japanese, a quarter English, a quarter Russian, a quarter French or Italian, like that."" Ohba said that L is the most intelligent character in the entire Death Note series because ""the plot requires it."" He added that he personally views L as ""slightly evil."" History At the age of eight, [ 4 ] L was found by Watari and taken to the orphanage known as Wammy's House , a home for gifted children. Sometime after, Watari realized that L had incredible intelligence and later assisted him in his cases. [ 5 ] L became a detective at a young, unknown age and eventually gained a reputation as the greatest detective in the world whose opinion is highly valued. Plot L notices the rapid rate of criminals dying of heart attacks, and suspects a person is behind this and that he is in Japan, so he seeks cooperation from the NPA . He begins the Kira case by having undocumented death row inmate Lind L. Tailor introduce himself on television as ""L"" and say that Kira is ""evil."" This provokes Kira into killing Tailor on the spot, which in turn confirms that the Kira killings are not a coincidental succession of heart attacks amongst criminals but the designs of an ingenious murderer who will kill any and all who try to stop him. It also reveals Kira's location, since the broadcast was televised only in the Kanto region. Not long after this, because of the time of day during which the criminals die coincide with out-of-school hours, he deduces that Kira may well be a student. Not long after this incident, criminals begin dying during one-hour intervals, intentionally contradicting L's theory, showing to L that Kira has access to police information. Because of this, he requests that 12 FBI agents investigate those close to each of the members of the police. Shortly after the FBI's investigation begins, Kira begins testing his abilities using criminals and leaves behind meaningless clues, successfully distracting L from the agents. Not too long after this, all 12 FBI agents die at Kira's hand. This causes a large portion of the NPA to quit the investigation, only leaving a few members, Soichiro Yagami , Touta Matsuda , Hirokazu Ukita , Shuichi Aizawa, and Kanzo Mogi . L books a hotel room where all six of them can regularly do their investigation, and he gives them counterfeit police badges as well as belt buckles which allow them to contact L in case of an emergency. L in the manga, declaring he is ""justice"" to the Task Force L finds footage of the death of one of the agents, and the footage shows that Raye Penber , who was investigating the families of Soichiro Yagami and Koreyoshi Kitamura , was reaching for something behind him when he died just outside the train. Furthermore, the body of Naomi Misora , who previously worked with L on the Los Angeles BB Serial Murder Cases and was Raye's fianc, went missing. L assumes this was the work of Kira because Naomi didn't seem like the type to commit suicide at the loss of her fianc. Because of these two factors, Kira must be among those whom Raye was investigating. L installs surveillance cameras and wiretaps in the Yagami household as well as Kitamura's house. However, L places 64 in the room of Light Yagami, Soichiro's son, whom L observes the closest. After seeing Light's alibi (which was that he writes a name in a blind spot whilst studying), L senses something is very off about Light, deeming him ""too perfect."" In order to take his investigation to its next stage, L decides to enroll at To-Oh University (, T Daigaku )the same college that Light attendsusing the well-known name of a popular singer and actor, Hideki Ryuga . L attends To-Oh because he feels confident in his reasoning and interrogational skills and wishes to test his theory concerning Light's hidden identity by confronting him and perhaps provoking or tricking him to admit that he is indeed Kira. L is well aware that this is something of a gamble, and knows full well that his act of direct confrontation could prove fatal, but as he's convinced he understands Light's thought process, he feels confident that the adversary will not yet risk revealing his secret identity by killing him. When L introduces himself as Ryuga, Light becomes alert and somewhat alarmed but recognizes that it would be pointless to attempt to kill himthe name is conspicuously fake. Light has no way of knowing whether Ryuga is the real L or a proxy acting under orders. He also reasons that L would have already introduced himself to Light's father earlier, and thus, were he to somehow kill L, this murder would instantly unmask him, proving that he is indeed Kira. If this person proved to be L's proxy, and his name really was Ryuga, he might die, but L would live and know his identity, without ever having had to reveal himself to Light, so that L will have gained all the advantage. Also, while writing the name ""Hideki Ryuga"" into the Death Note , the face of the pop singer bearing that name might enter Light's thoughts involuntarily, and that would cause the death of pop singer Ryuga, which would also lead L to the obvious conclusion that Light is Kira. As such, L's expectations about the outcome of his daring opening gambit prove true, and Light finds himself in a stalemate situation, unable to act for the time being, as any attempt to rid himself of his hunters would result in confirmed suspicions, his subsequent and unavoidable unmasking, and, ultimately, his undoing. L's loss against Light in tennis L plans on getting closer to Light by asking him to join the investigation; this way, if Light is Kira, he would be more prone to slipping up, while Light not being Kira would still benefit the investigation. L begins by playing a tennis game with Light, in order to have grounds to get closer to Light and begin asking him about the investigation; during the game, L concludes that Light will attempt to meet with the Task Force members in order to confirm L's identity. After losing the tennis match, in order to prevent Light from meeting with the Task Force members, L announces his suspicions, claiming his suspicions are only one percent high. L begins testing Light at the cafe, first by asking him about why L revealed himself, then about the file that the FBI agents received, and finally about three notes Kira left behind using criminals. Light passes all the tests and doesn't slip up, and so L doesn't bother trying to test him anymore. L then asks Light to join the investigation, but Light takes advantage of this by claiming that he'll refuse to join the investigation unless the Task Force members confirm L's identity. Considering L wants Light to join the investigation and he has another countermeasure to keep him safe anyway, L allows Light to have the Task Force members confirm his identity. Suddenly, L and Light receive news of Soichiro having collapsed of a heart attack due to stress, and at the hospital, L has Soichiro confirm his identity, while also asking for Light's thoughts on Kira's identity. After a while, Kira sends tapes to Sakura TV , which airs on TV. After Kira begins to kill innocents to prove the fact that they're Kira, the Task Force tries their best to stop the broadcast. After all the calls fail, Ukita attempts to barge in the station, only for him to somehow be killed. This shocks them and angers Aizawa as Kira shouldn't have been able to discover Ukita's name. Luckily, a recovered Soichiro barges in the station using a truck, confirming his safety, and retrieves the tapes from Demegawa , and hands them over to L and the Task Force. Judging from the fact that Kira can now kill with just a face and that Kira is uncharacteristically killing innocents, L speculates that this is indeed a second Kira who seeks the collaboration and attention of the first. Because Light's deductive abilities would be useful, L asks Light to join the Task Force. Because Light knows of L's identity, L has Watari pose as another L through a computer screen in order to prevent Light from killing L and the Task Force, as an outsider would notice their deaths should they occur. Together, they both manage to have the second Kira, who wishes to have L seen on TV, respond to them. In one of the responses, the second Kira mentions "" Shinigami ,"" and since their existence isn't implausible to L considering previous events, L is shocked and unsettled by the idea of him potentially needing to change his worldview. After the second Kira sends a diary, Light goes to Aoyama on May 22nd under the guise of investigating, only for him to find nothing. On May 23rd, the second Kira releases a tape announcing that she has found Kira, which has L suspect Light further considering this is probably referring to when Light went to Aoyama the previous day, so L has Mogi secretly tail Light. Judging from the fact that the second Kira now does not seek Kira's attention, L thinks that the second Kira and Kira have joined forces. After this, Light suddenly gains a gaggle of girlfriends, all of whom L investigates. L manages to discover that Misa Amane was ahold of these tapes thanks to the hairs and fibers on them. Thus, Misa Amane is the Second Kira. Her manager is then charged for drugs, and L meets Light again at the university. There, he meets Misa before she is detained. Because of this, Light is in deep trouble and he asks to be detained, and so L does so. During Light's confinement, no criminals are killed, which confirms to L that Light is Kira. During Light's seventh day of confinement, Light begins acting uncharacteristically as he lost his memories of being Kira. After fifteen days, criminals begin dropping dead again, and once 50 days have passed, the Task Force pressures L into releasing Light and Misa. However, before letting them free, L has Soichiro act as if he would shoot Light, as he believes that Misa would kill Soichiro in this situation. However, since she doesn't, L agrees to let them free. L sulking Still convinced Light and Misa are Kira and the second Kira, respectively, L handcuffs his hands to Light's. L asks Light to manipulate Misa into spilling information regarding the case, but Light refuses as it is against his moral code. While Light, L, and Misa are in Misa's room, L sulks over the fact that he has come to the conclusion that Light and Misa have lost their memories of having been Kira and passed on their powers to someone else, which would make solving the case very difficult. Frustrated with L's unwillingness to continue due to all that L has put Light through because of the case, Light punches L, and in response, L kicks Light before Matsuda intervenes and stops the fight. After a few months of not working on the case, L is shown Light's research; Light deduces Kira is now within the Yotsuba company and that Kira can kill through means other than heart attacks. Shortly after, because of the fact that Kira has bribed and blackmailed the NPA to not oppose Kira, Aizawa quits the Task Force in order to support his family after being fed up with L, who lied to Aizawa about him having to make a choice, as L had already ensured that anyone who would quit the NPA to work with the Task Force would be financially secure. L and the team watching over the Yotsuba members L hires Aiber and Wedy to help them with the investigation now that the Task Force is not a part of the police. Together, they all manage to concoct a plan, but Matsuda messes up by taking initiative and entering Yotsuba headquarters. In order to fix his mistakes, L tells Matsuda to fake his death. L takes advantage of his second alias, Eraldo Coil , whom Yotsuba hired in order to find L, to find out more information about the company, with Aiber communicating with them as Eraldo. When Misa finds evidence as to who the Third Kira is, L is a little underwhelmed, but comes up with a plan to stop Higuchi regardless. L uses Matsuda as bait during a Sakura TV talk show to lure Higuchi onto the scene, only for the Task Force members to ambush him. Higuchi makes an escape, but with the help of Ide and his return, the Task Force catches up to him. L finally discovers the Death Note, how Kira kills, and discovers the Shinigami, Rem . Light and Misa regain their memories as Kira, and L discovers a rule, one where if someone doesn't write within the notebook within 13 consecutive days, they die. Despite this being a perfect alibi for Light, L still suspects him. Due to pressure from the Task Force now believing Light and Misa are in the clear, L releases Misa and removes the handcuffs from his and Light's hands. L stands out in the rain, hearing the ""bells,"" and massages Light's feet after doing so . (This has happened only in the anime and is absent from the manga. Many fans interpret this as L having knowledge of his premature death.) A few killings after Misa's release, the killings from Kira start up again, resulting in L quarreling with the Task Force as he plans on using the notebook to test the legitimacy of the 13-day rule. However, just then, Watari has died, as he noticed all the data concerning the Kira case has been deleted. Once L figures out Rem must have killed Watari, Rem writes L's name in the notebook, killing him. As L has a heart attack, Light catches L and holds him by the arms, allowing L to see Light's smug smirk to show that he was indeed Kira the whole time. L's death in the anime Because of Wammy's House attempting to raise a successor to L, Near and Mello attempt to catch Kira, with Near doing this in order to avenge L and defend his pride. During some of his interactions with Near and Mello, Light remembers L. Ultimately, the combined efforts of Near and Mello succeed in defeating Light. In other media Film series Main article: L (character)/Films Death Note Kenichi Matsuyama as L in the Death Note film series L retains many of the same characteristics seen in the original series. At the end of the first film, L eats potato chips in front of Light; Light understood this to mean that L was still suspicious of him, as Light had used a potato chip bag to hide a mini LCD television from security cameras while L filmed his room. Death Note: The Last Name As there is no time delay between the first and second films, the second film begins soon before L supposedly dies. Unlike the manga and anime, in the second film, his original ""death,"" caused by Rem writing his name in her Death Note, does not take effect, as L had written his own name in Misa's Death Note earlier. It is his self-sacrifice that allows him to stay alive for a longer duration (as he supposed that Kira would kill him on that day), and allows the investigation team to apprehend Light. After Ryuk kills Light, Ryuk offers L the Death Note. L refuses, and Ryuk, while saying that L is boring, leaves. Twenty-three days after writing his name in the Death Note, and after burning all the remaining Death Notes and having a conversation with Soichiro Yagami, L dies peacefully while eating a chocolate bar, with a picture of Watari lying right beside him. L: Change the WorLd L: Change the WorLd chronicles the 23 days that L has left before he dies. L decides to solve one last case. He is in charge of stopping a deadly virus from spreading across the world. Ryuk comes to his aid on behalf of Kira's last wishes. Hideo Nakata, the director, told The Daily Yomiuri that he wanted to exhibit L's ""human side,"" a quality which was not made all too apparent in the Death Note series. Conception of L in the films Manga rendition of L's film portrayal Shsuke Kaneko, director of the films, said that L's role was the most difficult to cast; as the starting date of the shooting schedule drew near, many of the ""big name"" actors had other projects. Kaneko decided to offer the role to Ken'ichi Matsuyama, ""very much a newcomer."" When Matsuyama spoke to him of his intention to ""live as L,"" the young actor had ""clinched it,"" declares Kaneko. Matsuyama admits having experienced some difficulty in trying to portray L, and he worried about his performance. In the end, he decided to interpret L as an individual who does not ""quite understand other people on an emotional level""the actor reasoned that L rarely interacted with others, and as a consequence, his social skills and emotional expressiveness may not be those of a socially active person. Matsuyama, describing himself as ""not very flexible physically,"" encountered difficulty in emulating L's postures. The actor also ate sweets that L would eat, and carefully considered the details of L's signature gestures. Matsuyama said that he and Fujiwara became ""so immersed"" in their character portrayals, that they did not talk to one another while on the set; only when filming ceased did they converse, and they ""went out for a drink or two."" Matsuyama described L and Light as having ""such unique characters that they're impossible to understand"" and that ""the inside of L's head remains a mystery"" to him. Matsuyama said that L and Light are ""extremely"" alike in that they have ""very strong sense of justice."" Novels Death Note: Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases In the novel Death Note: Another Note , the reader is led to believe Lunder the alias, Rue Ryuzaki is helping Naomi Misora solve a murder case. She was recruited for the case by L because she was on leave from the FBI. This Rue acts very much like L and shared many characteristics like crouching to sit and consuming sweets. At the end of the novel, the reader discovers that Beyond Birthday detective name B, who was another candidate to replace L along with Near and Mello, was not only the killer but also Rue Ryuzaki in disguise under heavy make-up. He was trying to make a case L could not solve to prove his superiority to L. In the book, the only certified reference to L was the phone conversations Naomi had with him to discuss the case. At the very end of the book, as Naomi was going back to work, she sees a man similar to Rue, who the reader is led to believe is L (and probably is, considering that Mello earlier stated that this case was the first time that L had shown himself in public under the alias 'Ryuzaki'). This man attempts to give Naomi a hug, which she counters in self-defense and sends him tumbling down a flight of stairs. She then catches up to him and asks him his name, to which he replies, ""Ryuzaki."" It is revealed that, prior to the series, L once told Mello three stories regarding his previous solved casesthe Los Angeles BB Murder Cases, detective wars against the real Eraldo Coil and Deneuve , and the story of how L met Watari. [ 6 ] L: Change the WorLd Although following closely the storyline of its film counterpartwith the exception of a few creative changesthe novelization reveals various attributes of L. It is revealed in the novel that the initial ""L"" has two meanings: L stands for ""Last One,"" meaning no one could surpass or match him, but also for ""Lost One,"" meaning a gifted entity who has dropped down, or was cast out from heaven. The novel also states that L helped in the prevention of World War III when he was only eight years old. In the novel, L takes a few capoeira lessons from Suruga . This is most likely a homage to the on-going fan speculation of L's capoeira like fighting style in the Death Note manga and anime. Also, in the novel, L for the first time completely loses his composure and calm attitude: when Maki is kidnapped by Blue Ship, L breaks down and screams toward the sky after realizing that this was what Light meant about feeling helpless to protect the people he cares about. L also states at one point that ""his heart hurts."" His feelings about Light are also revealed, and it is described that L did consider Light to be his friend, going as far as holding on to Light's broken watch as a memento and saying, ""Light, I'll see you on the other side. Let us explore the world of nothingness together."" According to the timeline that is presented on each page of the novel, it appears L was to have only 272 days left to live prior to writing his name onto the page of the Death Note . Based on this bit of information, it's obvious that L's remaining natural lifespan at the end of the second film would only have amounted to less than a year. According to page 151 of the novel, it is revealed that the reason why L has acquired so many eccentric quirks is because of the heavy strain of upholding the name of L. From the novel: How L did not and could not forget the faces of thousands of victims. ""Who could comprehend the man who had lived his life, and had to live confronting all the lives ended prematurely, the tears of the grief stricken survivors, the devaluing of life as a daily reality. How was it possible to measure the pain of such a man? Was it a strain so heavy that L's back curved under all its weight? Was it an agony so terrible as to leave the indelible dark circles around his eyes? Was it a feeling so bitter that every bite he took needed to be coated in sugar? The chronically rounded shoulders, the inevitable dark circles, the eccentric tastesL suppressed the pain of being a champion of justice, but the evidence of the pain was molded into his very body."" L's detective skills are also explored. In the novel, L manages to disguise himself from Kujo and the Blue Ship members by wearing lipstick and putting on a women's wig. He even goes as far as playing the part, and calling Suruga ""Honey"" while in disguise, much to his annoyance. Yonkoma Main articles: Death Note 13: How to Read and Yonkoma Death Note 13: How to Read describes L in the Death Note yonkoma as the ""holder of the world's greatest mind"" and having the ""powerful ability to act like a fool."" Death Note 13: How to Read adds that in the yonkoma, ""it's like [L was] born to be mocked."" Musical Teppei Koike as L (Tokyo, 2015) L's role in Death Note: The Musical is essentially the same, but there are some notable changes to the plot. L does not create the Task Force; the Task Force is formed prior to his involvement, and Soichiro Yagami calls L in to assist on the case. The ending is also very different. Light convinces Rem to not just write L's name in the notebook but to also write the manner of L's death. As written, L goes to meet Light at a warehouse in Daikoku Wharf and he takes a gun. Light reveals himself as Kira and allows L to touch the Death Note and see Ryuk. L shoots Light in the leg, but Light reveals that this is all according to what's already been written, because Light intends to make it look like L himself was Kira and Light exposed him. Light guides the gun in L's hand to L's temple, and L pulls the trigger and dies. Kim Junsu as L (Seongnam, 2015) L is portrayed by various actors for the different musical productions. Teppei Koike (, Koike Teppei ) portrayed him in the 2015 Japanese production, and he will reprise the role in 2017. Kim Junsu () portrayed him in both the 2015 and 2017 Korean productions. Jarrod Spector voiced the character for the New York studio demo recordings. L performs the following songs in the Musical: "" The Game Begins "" ""Secrets and Lies"" "" Where is the Justice Reprise "" "" Stalemate aka A Game of Death"" "" The Way Things Are aka The Unwavering Truth"" "" Playing His Game aka Into Him"" "" The Way Things Are Reprise "" "" Last Moments "" Drama Kento Yamazaki as L L receives major changes in the drama adaptation. Unlike his manga and anime counterpart, this live-action L sits properly, albeit with his feet on tables and his legs crossed, regularly wears shoes, and eschews sweets and candy in favor of energy drinks. He is also portrayed as far more bold, evident in episode 2 when he accuses Light and several other suspects as being Kira over the phone without even using a voice scrambler. He shows more emotions than L does in the manga, screaming during his fight with Light and laughing when he knows he has Light cornered. L has a much closer relationship to Near in the drama, and the two of them regularly keep in touch over the phone. L is very wary of Near's ""Mello"" personality and does not hesitate to scold Mello when he comes out. It is for this reason that L attempts to keep Near sheltered, though he ultimately fails when Near escapes the Wammy House. The two spend time together in person, and L values Near's contribution to the Higuchi case and respects his establishment as a world-renowned detective. Netflix film Main article: L (character)/Netflix American actor Keith Stanfield portrays an American version of L in the 2017 Netflix adaptation of Death Note . Similar to the television drama, L's character and background have significant changes. Prior to the events of the film, L was raised in an orphanage in New York where he and several other children were trained by Watari to become the greatest detectives in the world. The orphanage was eventually abandoned soon after L's departure. L also rarely took time to sleep and ate nothing but sweets and required Watari's aid to maintain his health. Towards the film's third act, L displays an aggressive behavior that causes him to shout and even break things when he is angered. When Watari is killed, L's rage consumes him and he takes a gun in an attempt to hunt down Light Turner to avenge his mentor, but is knocked unconscious by a Kira worshipper before he can shoot Light. After being taken into custody by the police, L is able to avoid prison due to his contacts in the government, but he is deported and is to be sent back to Japan. Before his plane takes off, L remembers Mia's involvement with Light and he breaks into Mia's house. He searches through her belongings and finds a page of the Death Note with the names of the FBI agents on it. Out of anger, L grabs a pen and considers writing Light's name down. Conception The following information is from Death Note 13: How to Read . Tsugumi Ohba : Writer Takeshi Obata : Artist Overview Ohba created L as a ""force of justice"" and a ""super detective"" who stands between Light and Light's goals and advances the story. Ohba believed that the story would not hold much interest if L was significantly older than Light, so Ohba created L as a young adult. Ohba said that for L's name he wanted to use a single letter with a lot of significance; according to Ohba, he considered ""I"" and ""J"" but decided that they did not ""feel as good"" as ""L"" and settled on it ""after careful consideration."" Ohba mentions having given L the alias ""Ryuzaki"" because L is pronounced like R in Japanese. Ohba said that his favorite human character in the series was L as he believed that L was the ""strongest"" character in the series ""besides Light."" Obata also chose L as his favorite due to ""appearance, personality, everything."" He stated that he could never have created L and that he enjoyed drawing him. Obata added that because of this, L is not ""real"" to him, and he likes that aspect of L. In response to the question ""Who was the most fun to draw?"" both Ohba and Obata answered ""L."" Appearance Ohba claims he left ""everything"" about L's character design to Obata, who asked Ohba if L could be ""unattractive."" Afterwards, Ohba would include his ideas about the character into his thumbnails, including L's posture when seated, and notes such as: ""he's English,"" and ""he's listless."" He also added details regarding L's mannerisms, and his ""sweet tooth."" Apart from all that, Ohba credits Obata for the character designs. Obata described the thumbnail pictures of L created by Ohba as having a ""plain face with no expression,"" and no ""bags"" under his eyes. According to Obata, the thumbnail design was ""great, and I wish I could have used it as is."" Obata drew L as an ""attractive young man"" until Chapter 11, when the character appeared in person. After Chapter 11 Obata decided to contrast L's appearance with that of Light's; Obata claims that both he and Ohba held this idea. Obata speaks of his concern, during the development of the early manga chapters, that L would appear to be ""so suspicious that Light would know instantly it was L if they ever met."" When Obata's editor told him that he wanted L to have a face ""looking cool based on the angle,"" Obata added black ""bags"" under L's eyes, and he cited Devilman 's Akira Fudou when expressing his belief that black bags ""looked cool."" In addition, Obata thought of a ""dead eyes"" concept, which involved L having ""all-black eyes"" and ""mostly no eyebrows."" Although he believes that giving it such black eyes tends to make an animated character appear ""goofier,"" he also thinks that the bags ""sharpen the character's gaze."" Obata suggests that the design evokes ""a feeling of mystery"" surrounding the character, and as a result, the reader cannot determine L's true thoughts. He adds that the bags under L's eyes also attract speculation about L's lifestyle and past, and describes the bags as ""useful."" Obata designed L with a ""simple"" outfit of a white, long-sleeved shirt and jeans in order to convey the idea that L does not put much thought into choosing his attire. In Death Note 13: How to Read , Ohba presented an initial rough draft of L, and said that, with a ""cool expression"" and without the ""bags"" under his eyes the rough draft showed ""a totally different person."" While designing color book covers, Obata assigned colors to characters to ""get the atmosphere right."" The color he assigned to L was gold. Mannerisms Obata has stated his belief that traits exhibited by L are best revealed ""gradually."" He is convinced that if he drew L eating ""mountains of sweets"" prior to revealing L's face, the character would not have ""much credibility as a super detective,"" and people would question whether L was ""crazy."" Obata mentions being told often that L's fighting style is much like capoeira; the artist claims that he did not consider this when he drew L's fightshe was simply thinking of the most effective method of kicking an adversary while being handcuffed to him. In Obata's opinion, if the style resembles capoeira, then this ""adds another element to it"" and ""that makes me happy."" Trivia L's name, L Lawliet, was first revealed in Death Note 13: How to Read on a promotional card featured at the beginning of the book. L's lifespan in the anime In the anime, certain characters take on stylized hair colors while the viewer hears their thoughts; L's color is blue. L's lifespan in the television drama is 51161121. L can tie two cherry stems in a knot with his mouth, as seen in episode 18. In the Death Note DVD Behind the Scenes, L's voice actor, Alessandro Juliani, describes L as an ""enigma, and someone, that if you sat next to on the subway with you would probably move to the other side."" In the Italian version, rather than using the letter ""L"" to spell his name, the phonetic spelling (""Elle"") is used. In Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid episode 6, a character resembling L was briefly seen riding a bike. An L Nendoroid figure L was one of the Death Note characters made into Nendoroid figures. The L Nendoroid comes with a chair, an extra arm holding a cell phone, another body of L but in his crouching posture, and three other faces, an angry face, a shocked face, and a face looking to the right. American RB singer Christina Grimmie cosplayed as L for her 2015 music video of "" Shrug ."" Two versions of the music video were made with the L cosplay being used in the "" Dude Version ."" Quotes  Kira is childish and he hates losing I'm also childish and hate losing.

( Chapter 46 )  It's not a sense of justice. Figuring out difficult cases is my hobby. If you measured good and evil deeds by current laws, I would be responsible for many crimes. The same way you all like to solve mysteries and riddles, or clear video games more quickly. For me too, it's simply prolonging something I enjoy doing. That's why I only take on cases that pique my interest. It's not justice at all. And if it means being able to clear a case, I don't play fair, I'm a dishonest, cheating human being who hates losing.  ( Death Note One-Shot Special )  There aremany types of monsters in this world: Monsters who will not show themselves and who cause trouble; monsters who abduct children; monsters who devour dreams; monsters who suck blood, and monsters who always tell lies. Lying monsters are a real nuisance. They are much more cunning than other monsters. They pose as humans even though they have no understanding of the human heart. They eat even though they've never experienced hunger. They study even though they have no interest in academics. They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love. If I were to encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it. Because in truth, I am that monster.  ( Death Note Relight 2: L's Successors )  The killer is B.

It parses the input from L eft to right, performing L eftmost derivation of the sentence. An LL parser is called an LL( k ) parser if it uses k tokens of lookahead when parsing a sentence. A grammar is called an LL( k ) grammar if an LL( k ) parser can be constructed from it. A formal language is called an LL( k ) language if it has an LL( k ) grammar. The set of LL( k ) languages is properly contained in that of LL( k 1) languages, for each k  0. [ 1 ] A corollary of this is that not all context-free languages can be recognized by an LL( k ) parser. An LL parser is called LL-regular (LLR) if it parses an LL-regular language . [ clarification needed ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The class of LLR grammars contains every LL(k) grammar for every k. For every LLR grammar there exists an LLR parser that parses the grammar in linear time. [ citation needed ] Two nomenclative outlier parser types are LL() and LL(finite). A parser is called LL()/LL(finite) if it uses the LL()/LL(finite) parsing strategy. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] LL() and LL(finite) parsers are functionally closer to PEG parsers. An LL(finite) parser can parse an arbitrary LL(k) grammar optimally in the amount of lookahead and lookahead comparisons. The class of grammars parsable by the LL() strategy encompasses some context-sensitive languages due to the use of syntactic and semantic predicates and has not been identified. It has been suggested that LL() parsers are better thought of as TDPL parsers. [ 7 ] Against the popular misconception, LL() parsers are not LLR in general, and are guaranteed by construction to perform worse on average (super-linear against linear time) and far worse in the worst-case (exponential against linear time). LL grammars, particularly LL(1) grammars, are of great practical interest, as parsers for these grammars are easy to construct, and many computer languages are designed to be LL(1) for this reason. [ 8 ] LL parsers may be table-based, [ citation needed ] i.e. similar to LR parsers , but LL grammars can also be parsed by recursive descent parsers . According to Waite and Goos (1984), [ 9 ] LL( k ) grammars were introduced by Stearns and Lewis (1969). [ 10 ] Overview [ edit ] For a given context-free grammar , the parser attempts to find the leftmost derivation . Given an example grammar G : S  E displaystyle Sto E E  ( E  E ) displaystyle Eto (EE) E  i displaystyle Eto i the leftmost derivation for w  ( ( i  i )  i ) displaystyle w((ii)i) is: S  ( 1 ) E  ( 2 ) ( E  E )  ( 2 ) ( ( E  E )  E )  ( 3 ) ( ( i  E )  E )  ( 3 ) ( ( i  i )  E )  ( 3 ) ( ( i  i )  i ) displaystyle S overset (1)Rightarrow  E overset (2)Rightarrow  (EE) overset (2)Rightarrow  ((EE)E) overset (3)Rightarrow  ((iE)E) overset (3)Rightarrow  ((ii)E) overset (3)Rightarrow  ((ii)i) Generally, there are multiple possibilities when selecting a rule to expand the leftmost non-terminal. In step 2 of the previous example, the parser must choose whether to apply rule 2 or rule 3: S  ( 1 ) E  ( ? ) ? displaystyle S overset (1)Rightarrow  E overset (?)Rightarrow  ? To be efficient, the parser must be able to make this choice deterministically when possible, without backtracking. For some grammars, it can do this by peeking on the unread input (without reading). In our example, if the parser knows that the next unread symbol is ( , the only correct rule that can be used is 2. Generally, an LL( k ) parser can look ahead at k symbols. However, given a grammar, the problem of determining if there exists a LL( k ) parser for some k that recognizes it is undecidable. For each k , there is a language that cannot be recognized by an LL( k ) parser, but can be by an LL( k  1) . We can use the above analysis to give the following formal definition: Let G be a context-free grammar and k  1 . We say that G is LL( k ), if and only if for any two leftmost derivations: S    w A     w      w u displaystyle S Rightarrow  cdots  Rightarrow  wAalpha  Rightarrow  cdots  Rightarrow  wbeta alpha  Rightarrow  cdots  Rightarrow  wu S    w A     w      w v displaystyle S Rightarrow  cdots  Rightarrow  wAalpha  Rightarrow  cdots  Rightarrow  wgamma alpha  Rightarrow  cdots  Rightarrow  wv the following condition holds: the prefix of the string u displaystyle u of length k displaystyle k equals the prefix of the string v displaystyle v of length k implies    displaystyle beta gamma  . In this definition, S displaystyle S is the start symbol and A displaystyle A any non-terminal. The already derived input w displaystyle w , and yet unread u displaystyle u and v displaystyle v are strings of terminals. The Greek letters  displaystyle alpha  ,  displaystyle beta  and  displaystyle gamma  represent any string of both terminals and non-terminals (possibly empty). The prefix length corresponds to the lookahead buffer size, and the definition says that this buffer is enough to distinguish between any two derivations of different words. Parser [ edit ] The LL( k ) parser is a deterministic pushdown automaton with the ability to peek on the next k input symbols without reading. This peek capability can be emulated by storing the lookahead buffer contents in the finite state space, since both buffer and input alphabet are finite in size. As a result, this does not make the automaton more powerful, but is a convenient abstraction. The stack alphabet is   N   displaystyle Gamma Ncup Sigma  , where: N displaystyle N is the set of non-terminals;  displaystyle Sigma  the set of terminal (input) symbols with a special end-of-input (EOI) symbol  . The parser stack initially contains the starting symbol above the EOI: [ S  ] . During operation, the parser repeatedly replaces the symbol X displaystyle X on top of the stack: with some  displaystyle alpha  , if X  N displaystyle Xin N and there is a rule X   displaystyle Xto alpha  ; with  displaystyle epsilon  (in some notations  displaystyle lambda  ), i.e. X displaystyle X is popped off the stack, if X   displaystyle Xin Sigma  . In this case, an input symbol x displaystyle x is read and if x  X displaystyle xneq X , the parser rejects the input. If the last symbol to be removed from the stack is the EOI, the parsing is successful; the automaton accepts via an empty stack. The states and the transition function are not explicitly given; they are specified (generated) using a more convenient parse table instead. The table provides the following mapping: row: top-of-stack symbol X displaystyle X column:  w   k lookahead buffer contents cell: rule number for X   displaystyle Xto alpha  or  displaystyle epsilon  If the parser cannot perform a valid transition, the input is rejected (empty cells). To make the table more compact, only the non-terminal rows are commonly displayed, since the action is the same for terminals. Concrete example [ edit ] Set up [ edit ] To explain an LL(1) parser's workings we will consider the following small LL(1) grammar: S  F S  ( S  F ) F  a and parse the following input: ( a  a ) An LL(1) parsing table for a grammar has a row for each of the non-terminals and a column for each terminal (including the special terminal, represented here as  , that is used to indicate the end of the input stream). Each cell of the table may point to at most one rule of the grammar (identified by its number). For example, in the parsing table for the above grammar, the cell for the non-terminal 'S' and terminal ' ( ' points to the rule number 2: ( ) a   S 2  1   F   3   The algorithm to construct a parsing table is described in a later section, but first let's see how the parser uses the parsing table to process its input. Parsing procedure [ edit ] In each step, the parser reads the next-available symbol from the input stream, and the top-most symbol from the stack. If the input symbol and the stack-top symbol match, the parser discards them both, leaving only the unmatched symbols in the input stream and on the stack. Thus, in its first step, the parser reads the input symbol ' ( ' and the stack-top symbol 'S'. The parsing table instruction comes from the column headed by the input symbol ' ( ' and the row headed by the stack-top symbol 'S'; this cell contains '2', which instructs the parser to apply rule (2).  The parser has to rewrite 'S' to ' ( S  F ) ' on the stack by removing 'S' from stack and pushing ')', 'F', '  ', 'S', ' ( ' onto the stack, and this writes the rule number 2 to the output. The stack then becomes: [ ( , S,  , F, ) ,  ] In the second step, the parser removes the ' ( ' from its input stream and from its stack, since they now match. The stack now becomes: [ S,  , F, ) ,  ] Now the parser has an ' a' on its input stream and an 'S' as its stack top. The parsing table instructs it to apply rule (1) from the grammar and write the rule number 1 to the output stream. The stack becomes: [ F,  , F, ) ,  ] The parser now has an ' a' on its input stream and an 'F' as its stack top. The parsing table instructs it to apply rule (3) from the grammar and write the rule number 3 to the output stream. The stack becomes: [ a ,  , F, ) ,  ] The parser now has an ' a' on the input stream and an ' a ' at its stack top. Because they are the same, it removes it from the input stream and pops it from the top of the stack. The parser then has an '  ' on the input stream and '  ' is at the top of the stack meaning, like with 'a', it is popped from the stack and removed from the input stream. This results in: [ F, ) ,  ] In the next three steps the parser will replace 'F' on the stack by ' a ', write the rule number 3 to the output stream and remove the ' a ' and ' ) ' from both the stack and the input stream. The parser thus ends with '  ' on both its stack and its input stream. In this case the parser will report that it has accepted the input string and write the following list of rule numbers to the output stream: [ 2, 1, 3, 3 ] This is indeed a list of rules for a leftmost derivation of the input string, which is: S  ( S  F )  ( F  F )  ( a  F )  ( a  a ) Parser implementation in C [ edit ] Below follows a C implementation of a table-based LL parser for the example language:  include iostream  include map  include stack enum Symbols  // the symbols: // Terminal symbols: TS_L_PARENS , // ( TS_R_PARENS , // ) TS_A , // a TS_PLUS , //  TS_EOS , // , in this case corresponds to '0' TS_INVALID , // invalid token // Non-terminal symbols: NTS_S , // S NTS_F // F ; / Converts a valid token to the corresponding terminal symbol / Symbols lexer ( char c )  switch ( c )  case '(' : return TS_L_PARENS ; case ')' : return TS_R_PARENS ; case 'a' : return TS_A ; case '' : return TS_PLUS ; case '0' : return TS_EOS ; // end of stack: the  terminal symbol default : return TS_INVALID ;   int main ( int argc , char  argv )  using namespace std ; if ( argc  2 )  cout  ""usage: nt ll '(aa)'""  endl ; return 0 ;  // LL parser table, maps  non-terminal, terminal pair to action map  Symbols , map  Symbols , int   table ; stack  Symbols  ss ; // symbol stack char  p ; // input buffer // initialize the symbols stack ss . push ( TS_EOS ); // terminal,  ss . push ( NTS_S ); // non-terminal, S // initialize the symbol stream cursor p   argv [ 1 ][ 0 ]; // set up the parsing table table [ NTS_S ][ TS_L_PARENS ]  2 ; table [ NTS_S ][ TS_A ]  1 ; table [ NTS_F ][ TS_A ]  3 ; while ( ss . size ()  0 )  if ( lexer (  p )  ss . top ())  cout  ""Matched symbols: ""  lexer (  p )  endl ; p  ; ss . pop ();  else  cout  ""Rule ""  table [ ss . top ()][ lexer (  p )]  endl ; switch ( table [ ss . top ()][ lexer (  p )])  case 1 : // 1.

The number of the rule is written to the output stream. If the parsing table indicates that there is no such rule then the parser reports an error and stops. If the top is a terminal then the parser compares it to the symbol on the input stream and if they are equal they are both removed. If they are not equal the parser reports an error and stops. If the top is  and on the input stream there is also a  then the parser reports that it has successfully parsed the input, otherwise it reports an error. In both cases the parser will stop. These steps are repeated until the parser stops, and then it will have either completely parsed the input and written a leftmost derivation to the output stream or it will have reported an error. Constructing an LL(1) parsing table [ edit ] In order to fill the parsing table, we have to establish what grammar rule the parser should choose if it sees a nonterminal A on the top of its stack and a symbol a on its input stream. It is easy to see that such a rule should be of the form A  w and that the language corresponding to w should have at least one string starting with a . For this purpose we define the First-set of w , written here as Fi ( w ), as the set of terminals that can be found at the start of some string in w , plus  if the empty string also belongs to w . Given a grammar with the rules A 1  w 1 , ..., A n  w n , we can compute the Fi ( w i ) and Fi ( A i ) for every rule as follows: initialize every Fi ( A i ) with the empty set add Fi( w i ) to Fi ( A i ) for every rule A i  w i , where Fi is defined as follows: Fi( aw' )   a  for every terminal a Fi( Aw' )  Fi ( A ) for every nonterminal A with  not in Fi ( A ) Fi( Aw' )  ( Fi ( A )    )  Fi( w' ) for every nonterminal A with  in Fi ( A ) Fi()     add Fi( w i ) to Fi ( A i ) for every rule A i  w i do steps 2 and 3 until all Fi sets stay the same. The result is the least fixed point solution to the following system: Fi ( A )  Fi ( w ) for each rule A  w Fi ( a )   a , for each terminal a Fi ( w 0 w 1 )  Fi ( w 0 ) Fi ( w 1 ), for all words w 0 and w 1 Fi ()   where, for sets of words U and V, the truncated product is defined by U  V   ( u v ) : 1  u  U , v  V  displaystyle Ucdot V(uv):1mid uin U,vin V , and w:1 denotes the initial length-1 prefix of words w of length 2 or more, or w, itself, if w has length 0 or 1. Unfortunately, the First-sets are not sufficient to compute the parsing table. This is because a right-hand side w of a rule might ultimately be rewritten to the empty string. So the parser should also use the rule A  w if  is in Fi ( w ) and it sees on the input stream a symbol that could follow A . Therefore, we also need the Follow-set of A , written as Fo ( A ) here, which is defined as the set of terminals a such that there is a string of symbols Aa that can be derived from the start symbol. We use  as a special terminal indicating end of input stream, and S as start symbol. Computing the Follow-sets for the nonterminals in a grammar can be done as follows: initialize Fo ( S ) with    and every other Fo ( A i ) with the empty set if there is a rule of the form A j  wA i w' , then if the terminal a is in Fi ( w' ), then add a to Fo ( A i ) if  is in Fi ( w' ), then add Fo ( A j ) to Fo ( A i ) if w' has length 0, then add Fo ( A j ) to Fo ( A i ) repeat step 2 until all Fo sets stay the same. This provides the least fixed point solution to the following system: Fo ( S )     Fo ( A )  Fi ( w ) Fo ( B ) for each rule of the form B  ... A w Now we can define exactly which rules will appear where in the parsing table. If T [ A , a ] denotes the entry in the table for nonterminal A and terminal a , then T [ A , a ] contains the rule A  w if and only if a is in Fi ( w ) or  is in Fi ( w ) and a is in Fo ( A ). Equivalently: T [ A , a ] contains the rule A  w for each a  Fi ( w ) Fo ( A ). If the table contains at most one rule in every one of its cells, then the parser will always know which rule it has to use and can therefore parse strings without backtracking. It is in precisely this case that the grammar is called an LL(1) grammar . Constructing an LL( k ) parsing table [ edit ] The construction for LL(1) parsers can be adapted to LL( k ) for k  1 with the following modifications: the truncated product is defined U  V   ( u v ) : k  u  U , v  V  displaystyle Ucdot V(uv):kmid uin U,vin V , where w : k denotes the initial length- k prefix of words of length  k , or w , itself, if w has length k or less, Fo ( S )    k  Apply Fi (  )  Fi (  )  Fi (  ) also in step 2 of the Fi construction given for LL(1). In step 2 of the Fo construction, for A j  wA i w  simply add Fi ( w )  displaystyle cdot  Fo ( A j ) to Fo ( A i ). where an input is suffixed by k end-markers  , to fully account for the k lookahead context.  This approach eliminates special cases for , and can be applied equally well in the LL(1) case. Until the mid-1990s, it was widely believed that LL( k ) parsing [ clarify ] (for k  1) was impractical, [ 11 ] : 263265 since the parser table would have exponential size in k in the worst case. This perception changed gradually after the release of the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set around 1992, when it was demonstrated that many programming languages can be parsed efficiently by an LL( k ) parser without triggering the worst-case behavior of the parser.  Moreover, in certain cases LL parsing is feasible even with unlimited lookahead.  By contrast, traditional parser generators like yacc use LALR(1) parser tables to construct a restricted LR parser with a fixed one-token lookahead. Conflicts [ edit ] As described in the introduction, LL(1) parsers recognize languages that have LL(1) grammars, which are a special case of context-free grammars; LL(1) parsers cannot recognize all context-free languages. The LL(1) languages are a proper subset of the LR(1) languages, which in turn are a proper subset of all context-free languages.  In order for a context-free grammar to be an LL(1) grammar, certain conflicts must not arise, which we describe in this section. Terminology [ edit ] Let A be a non-terminal. FIRST( A ) is (defined to be) the set of terminals that can appear in the first position of any string derived from A . FOLLOW( A ) is the union over: [ 12 ] FIRST( B ) where B is any non-terminal that immediately follows A in the right-hand side of a production rule . FOLLOW( B ) where B is any head of a rule of the form B  wA . LL(1) conflicts [ edit ] There are two main types of LL(1) conflicts: FIRST/FIRST conflict [ edit ] The FIRST sets of two different grammar rules for the same non-terminal intersect. An example of an LL(1) FIRST/FIRST conflict: S - E  E 'a' E - 'b'   FIRST( E )   b ,  and FIRST( E a )   b , a , so when the table is drawn, there is conflict under terminal b of production rule S . Special case: left recursion [ edit ] Left recursion will cause a FIRST/FIRST conflict with all alternatives. E - E '' term  alt1  alt2 FIRST/FOLLOW conflict [ edit ] The FIRST and FOLLOW set of a grammar rule overlap. With an empty string () in the FIRST set, it is unknown which alternative to select. An example of an LL(1) conflict: S - A 'a' 'b' A - 'a'   The FIRST set of A is  a , , and the FOLLOW set is  a . Solutions to LL(1) conflicts [ edit ] Left factoring [ edit ] A common left-factor is ""factored out"". A - X  X Y Z becomes A - X B B - Y Z   Can be applied when two alternatives start with the same symbol like a FIRST/FIRST conflict. Another example (more complex) using above FIRST/FIRST conflict example: S - E  E 'a' E - 'b'   becomes (merging into a single non-terminal) S - 'b'    'b' 'a'  'a' then through left-factoring, becomes S - 'b' E  E E - 'a'   Substitution [ edit ] Substituting a rule into another rule to remove indirect or FIRST/FOLLOW conflicts. Note that this may cause a FIRST/FIRST conflict. Left recursion removal [ edit ] See [ 13 ] For a general method, see removing left recursion . A simple example for left recursion removal: The following production rule has left recursion on E E - E '' T E - T This rule is nothing but list of Ts separated by ''. In a regular expression form T ('' T). So the rule could be rewritten as E - T Z Z - '' T Z Z -  Now there is no left recursion and no conflicts on either of the rules. However, not all context-free grammars have an equivalent LL(k)-grammar, e.g.: S - A  B A - 'a' A 'b'   B - 'a' B 'b' 'b'   It can be shown that there does not exist any LL(k)-grammar accepting the language generated by this grammar.
